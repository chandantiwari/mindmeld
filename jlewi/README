Calculation of Grant Lewi numbers using decans
===================================================

This software package is built on the SwissEph package. It strives to
provide a cleaner interface for decan calculation to SwissEph, without
having to learn its details.

Among the things we improved;

o We provide a *precompiled* source base for SwissEph. The package, as
it is found on the Web, makes it necessary to pass through a
precompilation stage, similar to software written in C,C++ using
#define, #endif constructs. However, this usage is very un-Java, hence
only one version of the source is included in this package. This saves
the programmer from understanding unnecessary details of the package
involved.

o Calculating the decan (decanate) of planets needed for a certain
date in question. This was very hard to access through the SwissEph
regular functions, so we hacked through the command line interface
making SwissEph believe we were using it through the command line, we
parse the output, providing you the nice information you get for your
further calculations through a simple calc() function.


COMPILING
=========

Ant is used to automate all build related tasks. Simply type "ant" in the
project directory, and you will get a jlewi.jar file. To run tests, type
"ant test". If you do not know what Ant is, go to http://ant.apache.org. 

HOW TO USE
============

o Just include the jar file in your lib, then:

Lewi l = new Lewi();
int decan = l.calc(SweConst.MARS, "29.10.1965");

To calculate Lewi numbers

Lewi l = new Lewi();
ArrayList r = l.calc("1.3.1933");

Also, you can generate all Lewi numbers for 20th century by using "ant
run" which calls GenerateLewi.java class.
