<h3>AB</h3>
<p> 
The Blood Type AB Individualized Lifestyle 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
Type AB blood is rare - it's found in less than five percent of the 
population. And it is the newest of the blood types. Until ten or twelve 
centuries ago, there was no Type AB blood type. Type AB resulted from the 
intermingling of Type A with Type B. Type AB is the only blood type whose 
existence is the result of intermingling rather than environment. Thus, they 
share both the benefits and the challenges of both Type A and Type B blood 
types. Type AB has a unique chameleon like quality - depending on the 
circumstances, this blood type can appropriate the characteristics of each of 
the other blood types. Type AB is sometimes A-like, sometimes B-like and 
sometimes a fusion of both. Today, as we look back at this remarkable 
evolutionary revolution, it is clear that the genetic characteristics of our 
ancestors live in our blood today.

Type AB reflects the mixed inheritance of their A and B genes. According to 
Dr. D'Adamo, "Type AB has Type A's low stomach acid, however, they also have 
Type B's adaptation to meats. Therefore, you lack enough stomach acid to 
metabolize them efficiently and the meat you eat tends to get stored as 
fat. Your Type B propensities cause the same insulin reaction as Type B when you 
eat lima beans, corn, buckwheat, or sesame seeds." Inhibited insulin production 
results in hypoglycemia, a lowering of blood sugar after meals and leads to less 
efficient metabolism of foods. 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
Type AB should avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially when you're in stressful 
situations. Dr. D'Adamo recommends that Type AB focus on foods such as tofu, 
seafood, dairy and green vegetables if you are trying to lose weight. "Avoid 
all smoked or cured meats. These foods can cause stomach cancer in people with 
low levels of stomach acid," recommends Dr. D'Adamo. There is a wide variety 
of seafood for Type AB, and it is an excellent source of protein for Type AB. A 
few highly beneficial fish are mahi-mahi, red snapper, salmon, sardines, and 
tuna.. Some dairy is also beneficial for Type AB - especially cultured dairy 
such as Yogurt and kefir.

Stress and Exercise 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
Even though people have different capabilities for accommodating stress, we 
ultimately all have a breaking point. Given enough stressors of a high enough 
intensity for a long enough period of time, anyone will maladapt. For a Type AB, 
when it comes to stress hormones, you most resemble Type O in your tendency to 
overproduce catecholamines like adrenaline. Yet you also have the additional 
complexity of Type B's rapid clearing of nitrous oxide, so you suffer the 
physical consequences of high emotions. Your greatest danger is the tendency to 
internalize your emotions, especially anger and hostility, which is much more 
damaging to your health than externalizing it. Exercise plays a critical 
component in stress reduction and maintaining a healthy emotional balance for 
Type AB. Dr. D'Adamo recommends a combination of both calming activities and 
more intense physical exercise to help maintain an optimal balance. For example, 
three days of aerobic exercise such as running or biking and two days of calming 
exercise such as yoga or tai chi.

Personality 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
Type AB often receives mixed messages about emotional health. While you tend to 
be drawn to other people and are friendly and trusting, there is a side of you 
that feels alienated from the larger community. At your best, you are intuitive 
and spiritual, with an ability to look beyond the rigid confines of society. You 
are passionate in your beliefs, but you also want to be liked by others and this 
can create conflicts. In an independent study, Type ABs described themselves as 
emotional, passionate, friendly, trusting and empathetic. Type ABs are 
considered some of the most interesting of the blood types, both John F. Kennedy 
and Marilyn Monroe were Type ABs and although both are long gone, they hold a 
place in our national psyche to this day. 
 
<br/><br/> 

<p>
Type A's will not be very good in competitive sports, such as basketball,
football, soccer, they won't have the "in your bones" fanatical interest in
them, even as spectators. This does not mean other kinds of sports, or an
interest in martial arts, weight lifting is not possible.

Here are Dr. D'Adamo's key lifestyle strategies for people with Blood Type AB: 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
    <li>Cultivate your social nature in welcoming environments. Avoid situations that are highly competitive</li> 
    <li>Avoid ritualistic thinking and fixating on issues, especially those you can't control or influence</li> 
    <li>Develop a clear plan for goals and tasks - annually, monthly, weekly,
    daily - to avoid rushing</li> 
    <li>Make lifestyle changes gradually, rather than trying to tackle everything at once</li> 
    <li>Engage in forty-five to sixty minutes of aerobic exercise at least twice a week. Balanced by daily stretching, medititation or yoga</li> 
    <li>Engage in a community, neighborhood or other group activity that gives you a meaningful connection to a group</li> 
    <li>Also carve out time alone. Have at least one sport, hobby or activity that you perform independently of others</li> 
    <li>Break up your workday with some physical activity, especially if your
    job is sedentary. You'll feel more energized</li>
