<h3>ISTP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/istp.html

<br/>
<br/>

Like their fellow SPs, ISTPs are fundamentally Performers (note the capital 'P'
:-)), but as Ts their areas of interest tend to be mechanical rather than
artistic like those of ISFPs, and unlike most ESPs they do not present an
impression of constant activity. On the contrary, they lie dormant, saving their
energy until a project or an adventure worthy of their time comes along--and
then they launch themselves at it. The apparently frenzied state that inevitably
ensues is actually much more controlled than it appears--ISTPs always seem to
know what they're doing when it comes to physical or mechanical obstacles--but
the whole chain of events presents a confusing and paradoxical picture to an
outsider.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs are equally difficult to understand in their need for personal space,
which in turn has an impact on their relationships with others. They need to be
able to "spread out"--both physically and psychologically--which generally
implies encroaching to some degree on others, especially if they decide that
something of someone else's is going to become their next project. (They are
generally quite comfortable, however, with being treated the same way they treat
others--at least in this respect.) But because they need such a lot of
flexibility to be as spontaneous as they feel they must be, they tend to become
as inflexible as the most rigid J when someone seems to be threatening their
lifestyle (although they usually respond with a classic SP rage which is yet
another vivid contrast to their "dormant," impassive, detached mode). These
territorial considerations are usually critical in relationships with ISTPs;
communication also tends to be a key issue, since they generally express
themselves non-verbally. When they do actually verbalize, ISTPs are masters of
the one-liner, often showing flashes of humor in the most tense situations; this
can result in their being seen as thick-skinned or tasteless.

<br/>
<br/>

Like most SPs, ISTPs may have trouble with rote and abstract classroom learning,
which tend not to be good measures of their actual intelligence. They tend,
sometimes with good reason, to be highly skeptical of its practical value, and
often gravitate towards classes in industrial arts; part-time vocational/
technical programs can be useful to even the college-bound ISTP. In terms of
careers, mechanics and any of the skilled trades are traditional choices, and
those ISTPs with strong numerical as well mechanical gifts tend to do extremely
well in most areas of engineering. Working as paramedics or firefighters can
fulfill the ISTP need to live on the edge; they are at their best in a crisis,
where their natural disregard for rules and authority structures allows them to
focus on and tackle the emergency at hand in the most effective way.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs with more sedate careers usually take on high-risk avocations like racing,
skydiving, and motorcycling. While aware of the dangers involved, they are so in
touch with the physical world that they know they can get away with much smaller
safety margins than other types.

The Mechanic

<br/>
<br/>

As an ISTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal
with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you
take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.

ISTPs have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. They're good at
logical analysis, and like to use it on practical concerns. They typically have
strong powers of reasoning, although they're not interested in theories or
concepts unless they can see a practical application. They like to take things
apart and see the way they work.

ISTPs have an adventuresome spirit. They are attracted to motorcycles,
airplanes, sky diving, surfing, etc. They thrive on action, and are usually
fearless. ISTPs are fiercely independent, needing to have the space to make
their own decisions about their next step. They do not believe in or follow
rules and regulations, as this would prohibit their ability to "do their own
thing". Their sense of adventure and desire for constant action makes ISTPs
prone to becoming bored rather quickly.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs are loyal to their causes and beliefs, and are firm believers that people
should be treated with equity and fairness. Although they do not respect the
rules of the "System", they follow their own rules and guidelines for behavior
faithfully. They will not take part in something which violates their personal
laws. ISTPs are extremely loyal and faithful to their "brothers".

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs like and need to spend time alone, because this is when they can sort
things out in their minds most clearly. They absorb large quantities of
impersonal facts from the external world, and sort through those facts, making
judgments, when they are alone.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs are action-oriented people. They like to be up and about, doing
things. They are not people to sit behind a desk all day and do long-range
planning. Adaptable and spontaneous, they respond to what is immediately before
them. They usually have strong technical skills, and can be effective technical
leaders. They focus on details and practical things. They have an excellent
sense of expediency and grasp of the details which enables them to make quick,
effective decisions.
<br/>
<br/>


ISTPs avoid making judgments based on personal values - they feel that judgments
and decisions should be made impartially, based on the fact. They are not
naturally tuned in to how they are affecting others. They do not pay attention
to their own feelings, and even distrust them and try to ignore them, because
they have difficulty distinguishing between emotional reactions and value
judgments. This may be a problem area for many ISTPs.

<br/>
<br/>

An ISTP who is over-stressed may exhibit rash emotional outbursts of anger, or
on the other extreme may be overwhelmed by emotions and feelings which they feel
compelled to share with people (often inappropriately). An ISTP who is down on
themself will foray into the world of value judgments - a place which is not
natural for the ISTP - and judge themself by their inability to perform some
task. They will then approach the task in a grim emotional state, expecting the
worst.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs are excellent in a crisis situations. They're usually good athletes, and
have very good hand-eye coordination. They are good at following through with a
project, and tying up loose ends. They usually don't have much trouble with
school, because they are introverts who can think logically. They are usually
patient individuals, although they may be prone to occasional emotional
outbursts due to their inattention to their own feelings.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs have a lot of natural ability which makes them good at many different
kinds of things. However, they are happiest when they are centered in
action-oriented tasks which require detailed logical analysis and technical
skill. They take pride in their ability to take the next correct step.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs are optimistic, full of good cheer, loyal to their equals, uncomplicated
in their desires, generous, trusting and receptive people who want no part in
confining commitments.

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/>
<br/>
Dominant: Introverted Thinking
<br/>
Auxiliary: Extraverted Sensing
<br/>
Tertiary: Introverted Intuition
<br/>
Inferior: Extraverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTP

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ISTPs as Crafters, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Artisan. ISTPs account for about 4-6% of the
population.[2]

<br/>
<br/>

* I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: ISTPs tend to be quiet and
  reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather
  than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social
  situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).[5]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ISTPs tend to be more concrete than
  abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than the big
  picture, and on immediate realities rather than future possibilities .[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* T - Thinking preferred to feeling: ISTPs tend to rely on objective criteria
  rather than personal values. When making decisions, they generally give more
  weight to logic than to social considerations.[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* P - Perception preferred to judgment: ISTPs tend to withhold judgment and
  delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should
  circumstances change.[8]

Myers-Briggs description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Myers-Briggs, ISTPs excel at analyzing situations to reach the
heart of a problem so that they can swiftly implement a functional repair,
making them ideally suited to the field of engineering. Naturally quiet people,
they are interested in understanding how systems operate, focusing on efficient
operation and structure. They are open to new information and approaches. But
contrary to their seemingly detached natures, ISTPs are often capable of
humorously insightful observations about the world around them. They can also be
closet daredevils who gravitate toward fast-moving or risky hobbies (such as
bungee jumping, hang gliding, racing, motorcycling, and parachuting),
recreational sports (such as downhill skiing, paintball, ice hockey, and scuba
diving), and careers (such as aviation and firefighting).

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs may sometimes seem to act without regard for procedures, directions,
protocol, or even their own safety. But while their approach may seem haphazard,
it is in fact based on a broad store of knowledge developed over time through
action and keen observation. ISTPs enjoy self-sufficiency and take pride in
developing their own solutions to problems.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTPs are content to let others live according to their own rules, as long as
the favor is reciprocated. ISTPs endure reasonable impositions without
complaint-but if their "territory" is encroached upon, eroded, or violated, they
defend what they view as rightfully theirs.[citation needed]

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Keirsey, Crafter Artisans are masters at using tools of every
type-artistic, technological, martial. Although they are introverts, they are
authoritarian in their interactions with others and can be forceful at
influencing people. They focus on accomplishing tasks efficiently and
skillfully.

<br/>
<br/>

To master the tool of their interest, ISTPs require a certain degree of
seclusion in which to practice. The result is often a virtuosity that other
types find difficult to match.[11]

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functions (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) form a
hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's so-called default pattern of
behavior.

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information gathering
function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making function
(thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less developed
than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding out the
person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's Achilles'
heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the Tertiary,
the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[12]

<br/>
<br/>

Jung and Myers considered the attitude of the Auxiliary, Tertiary, and Inferior
functions to be the opposite of the Dominant. In this interpretation, if the
Dominant function is extraverted, then the other three are introverted, and vice
versa. However, many modern practitioners hold that the attitude of the Tertiary
function is the same as the Dominant.[4] Using the more modern interpretation,
the cognitive functions of the ISTP are as follows:[12]

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Introverted thinking (Ti)

<br/>
<br/>

Ti seeks precision, such as the exact word to express an idea. It notices the
minute distinctions that define the essence of things, then analyzes and
classifies them. Ti examines all sides of an issue, looking to solve problems
while minimizing effort and risk. It uses models to root out logical
inconsistency.[13] ISTPs live in a world of logic, on which they base their
decisions. They process information from their auxiliary function to create
strategies for action at a moment's notice. They love to examine complicated
systems.

<br/>
<br/>

Auxiliary: Extraverted sensing (Se)

<br/>
<br/>

Se focuses on the experiences and sensations of the immediate, physical
world. With an acute awareness of the present surroundings, it brings relevant
facts and details to the forefront and may lead to spontaneous action.[14] This
function drives ISTPs to embrace opportunities to plunge headfirst into
experiences. It also gives them a keen insight into situations similar to that
of the ISTJ. Their curiosity for the world around them gives them a "leap before
you look" tendency. They are notorious for taking apart a device to see how it
works before considering whether they can put it back together.

<br/>
<br/>

Tertiary: Introverted intuition (Ni)

<br/>
<br/>

Attracted to symbolic actions or devices, Ni synthesizes seeming paradoxes to
create the previously unimagined. These realizations come with a certainty that
demands action to fulfill a new vision of the future, solutions that may include
complex systems or universal truths.[15] Never as open in their theorizing as
INTPs, ISTPs prefer to keep themselves grounded in the physical situation, using
Ni to visualize components and concepts that they cannot see and touch
firsthand, such as the wiring in a circuit board.

<br/>
<br/>

Inferior: Extraverted feeling (Fe)

<br/>
<br/>

Fe seeks social connections and creates harmonious interactions through polite,
considerate, and appropriate behavior. Fe responds to the explicit (and
implicit) wants of others, and may even create an internal conflict between the
subject's own needs and the desire to meet the needs of others.[16] A weak point
of ISTPs, Fe may lead them to interpret criticisms of their ideas as criticisms
of their competence. ISTPs strive to follow the edicts of logic, but when they
are under stress, their inferior function can lead them to illogically and
stubbornly cling to their own ideas-sometimes to their own detriment, or even
when proven wrong.[12]

<br/><br/>

http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/myers-briggs/intp.htm

<br/><br/>

ISTPs direct their energy toward the inner world of thoughts (and,
maybe, emotions). They analyse situations and come up with
explanations of how things work. They prefer dealing with tangible
problems and proven experience - they often enjoy solving
organisational problems that need to be thought through.

<br/><br/>

What makes an ISTP tick?

<br/><br/>

The Dominant function is the judging one of Thinking. Characteristics associated with this function include:

<br/><br/>

Likes making decisions on the basis of logic, using objective considerations
Is concerned with truth, principles and justice
Is analytical and critical, tending to see the flaws in situations
Takes an objective approach 
    
<br/><br/>

The judging Thinking function is introverted. That is, Thinking is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The ISTP will therefore:

<br/><br/>

spend time thinking analytically, organising thoughts on a logical basis
develop an understanding of the principles involved in a situation
spontaneously feel critical of a person or situation, but not necessarily express that criticism
be inwardly decisive, but not communicate those decisions to others
think mostly about impersonal issues, focusing more on concepts, truths and systems rather than individuals' feelings 

<br/><br/>

The Thinking function is primarily supported by extraverted Sensing perception. That is, Sensing perception is used primarily to manage the outer world of actions and spoken words. This will modify the way that the Thinking is directed, by:

<br/><br/>

    focusing the (inner world) Thinking on understanding practical or mechanical problems
<br/>
    perceiving appropriate facts to support the logical analysis 

<br/><br/>

The classic temperament of an ISTP is Dionesian, or Sanguine, for whom freedom is a basic driving force - seeking to enjoy the present.
Contributions to the team of an ISTP

<br/><br/>

In a team environment, the ISTP can contribute by:

<br/><br/>

    being a source of information, or an 'expert' in some subjects
<br/>
    using analytical skills to produce practical solutions to difficult problems
<br/>
    encouraging the team to think, and then act
<br/>
    having a cool head in a crisis
<br/>
    applying relevant and realistic logical arguments
<br/>
    encouraging the team to realistically assess the situation 

<br/><br/>

The potential ways in which an ISTP can irritate others include:

<br/><br/>

    focusing too much on the current task at the expense of longer term or interpersonal issues
<br/>
    not seeing the wood for the trees
<br/>
    not completing a task before moving on to the next one
<br/>
    not communicating his/her understanding of the situation
<br/>
    taking shortcuts
<br/>
    seeming to flit from one thing to another 

<br/><br/>

Personal Growth

<br/><br/>

As with all types, the ISTP can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as:

<br/><br/>

    taking time to consider the impact of the ISTP's approach and ideas on people's feelings
<br/>
    expressing appreciation towards others
<br/>
    consulting others, to engender ownership of the solution
<br/>
    learning to acknowledge and develop the ISTP's own emotions and personal values
<br/>
    developing a long term personal strategy
<br/>
    developing personal relationships for their own sake 

<br/><br/>

Recognising Stress

<br/><br/>

As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the ISTP will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the ISTP might:

<br/><br/>

    withdraw from people, to think through possible solutions
<br/>
    use tried and trusted solutions to short-term problems
<br/>
    criticise others efforts and ignore their feelings
<br/>
    sort out detailed points that could perhaps wait 

<br/><br/>

Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the ISTP's shadow may appear
- a negative form of ENFJ. Example characteristics are: 

<br/><br/>

    displaying intense feelings towards others, or insisting on things being done without any logical basis
<br/>
    being very sensitive to criticism
<br/>
    having a gloomy view of the future
<br/>
    attributing unrealistic negative meaning to others actions or statements 

<br/><br/>

The shadow is part of the unconscious that is often visible to others,
onto whom the shadow is projected. The ISTP may therefore readily see
these faults in others without recognising it in him/her self.

<br/><br/>

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISTP_rel.html

<br/><br/>

ISTPs are generally extremely capable individuals who are good at most
things which interest them. They are usually bright, interesting, and
exciting individuals with a lot to offer. They live almost entirely in
the present moment, and usually do not make commitments beyond the
immediate foreseeable future. An ISTP probably coined the phrase
"nothing is unconditional". They strongly prefer to take things one
day at a time, rather than make long-term commitments. If a
relationship interests them and satisfies their needs, the ISTP will
do their part on a daily basis to keep the relationship strong and
healthy. If they lose interest in a relationship, their natural
tendency will be to move on.

<br/><br/>

http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/psychology-personality-tests.html

<br/><br/>

If psychology personality tests identify you as an ISTP, you are an introvert, sensing and thinking perceiver. You charge your batteries from your inner world but take information primarily with your five senses. Your logical decisions may qualify you for analytical personality types but your procrastination may defeat the purpose.

<br/><br/>

Psychology personality tests associate you with those jobs where
practical work is involved. However, you are deeply interested to know
how things practically work. You don't pay attention towards abstract
ideas and theories. You live in the present day and the extreme types
may miss future possibilities and hidden potentials. When you
continuously miss opportunities, you need to focus your observations
outward. Sociability and analytical mind shall bring them in your
way. 

<br/><br/>

Psychology personality tests vote you for those works where a lot of
routine and scheduling is not involved. They always look for more time
to complete their tasks. They should set their own deadlines a bit
earlier to the real ones. They are considered suitable for adventurous
careers where physical exercise and flexibility of sudden action is
involved. Some of the considered careers include: 

<br/><br/>

Police Officers, Pilots, Fire Fighters, Electrical Engineers, Athlete
Coaches, Athletes, Circus Artists, Race Car Drivers, Mechanics,
Computer programmers and Network Analysts, Radiologists, Private
Detectives

<br/><br/>

http://www.knowyourtype.com/istp.html

<br/><br/>

The ISTP is ready to try anything once. Keeping others off-guard is
the environment the ISTP is happy with, whether its taking charge to
fix a problem or generating a burst of humor that turns into the life
of a party. This can be tough for friends. 

<br/><br/>

Being in a relationship with an ISTP can be difficult due to the hands
off attitude they often posses. They are loath to change especially if
they believe others are attempting to control them. Their spontaneous
nature is usually good natured and fun. 

<br/><br/>

Family events are a mixed bag for the ISTP. The ISTP has little need for the social activity such events bring but rather enjoys the procedure. After an event, in the glow of success or failure, is where many ISTP�s will look for social interaction.
Career

<br/><br/>

Work that is routine like an administrator or open-ended like research is not what the ISTP is looking for. They need a career that will allow for spontaneous energy in problem solving and have a tangible, achievable goal. Other popular ISTP career directions include: Pilot, Police Cfficer, Medical Technician, and Paralegal.
Education

<br/><br/>

Learning is most enjoyable for the ISTP when it is relevant and
experimental. The best way to learn is by doing in the ISTP world. The
more abstract a class becomes, the less an ISTP will become, don't be
surprised to hear the phrase "what does this have to do with
anything?" come out of the ISTP's mouth.

<br/><br/>

http://www.istps.com/

<br/><br/>

ISTP (introverted - sensing - thinking - perceiving) is one of the 16
MBTI and Keirsey personality types. This type is primarily focused
internally, although ISTPs in general tend to like action and
adventure (but not as much as ESTPs). That internal focus makes them
quite tolerant to being alone and they often even enjoy getting away
from people to sort things out in their head.

<br/><br/>

Even though they are sharp introverted thinkers they aren't too big on
theories. If a theory has no visible application in real life it won't
hold an ISTPs interest for too long. They are a type that usually has
a good grip on reality because they are concentrated on the present
and are well aware of their surroundings. The bad side of this is that
it may make them lousy at long range planning. 

<br/><br/>

When faced with making a decision they lean towards logic, principles
and reason rather than the feelings of others. They are not very
decisive though, and will often delay a decision out of fear of
overlooking important facts.

<br/><br/>

usually very skillful with physical stuff (sports, operating vehicles,
machines, using tools) 
<br/>
good listeners
<br/>
like to figure things out by themselves
<br/>
usually easy going, optimistic and fun to be around
<br/>
observant (constantly gather tons of details about the environment and
process them) 
<br/>
generally good at problem solving and coming up with solutions on the spot
<br/>
not afraid to try new things
<br/>
independent and determined
<br/>
able to stay calm in crysis situations (because of this many ISTPs end
up as firefighters, detectives, ambulance drivers, in rescue teams…) 
<br/>
usually quite self-confident
<br/>
as introverts they don't have trouble respecting other's needs for
privacy or alone time 
<br/>
don't run away from conflict or criticism
<br/>
able to dole out discipline although they're not interested in doing so
<br/>
practical and have a good grip on reality and what's going on around them

<br/><br/>

http://community.nbtsc.org/wiki/ISTP;1.8

<br/><br/>

The ISTP takes hir energy from the inner world of thoughts (and,
maybe, emotions). Ze prefers dealing with facts and making decisions
on a logical basis. Hir life is flexible, demonstrating an interest in
acquiring new information that leads to a practical understanding of
the way the world works. Ze is quiet and detached, and adaptable (up
to a point). Ze is often good at solving organisational problems that
need to be thought through. Ze is curious about how and why things
work, and can seem impulsive, sometimes producing surprising ideas or
doing something unpredictable. 

<br/><br/>

From the book /Type Talk/ :

<br/><br/>

The motto, "Don't tread on me," could easily be of ISTP origin. It
reflects that type in many ways. It could mean "Don't tread on me
because I don't know how I'll react," or "Don't do it because I
wouldn't think of doing it to you," or "Don't do it because it is a
waste of time and energy."

<br/><br/>

ISTPs are especially skilled with their hands and often get
satisfaction from accomplishments that are both tactile and
immediate. When some/thing/ - as opposed to some/one/ - needs
attention, the ISTP's powers of observation (related to both their
Sensing and Perceiving preferences) make it possible for them to
plunge into the task at hand without feeling it necessary to follow
procedures or read directions. This is how the ISTP prefers to work,
and when the result is success, the ISTP feels a wonderful sense of
accomplishment. If, midway into a project, the need for directions
becomes apparent, the ISTP will refer only to sections that are
directly relevant, so that no time or energy is wasted - a matter of
great consequence to ISTPs.

<br/><br/>

The ISTPs' area of interest will take precedence over assigned tasks
that are perceived as dull, boring, or not practical. They can become
so engrossed with their own projects that other obligations, if not
abandoned outright or forgotten, take second place. In situations that
excite them, they work with great accuracy and precision, often to the
amazement and envy of others. They thrive on and prefer "working on
the edge," even putting themselves at risk, if that's what it takes to
get the job done.

<br/><br/>

Relating to ISTPs can be both fun and confusing - fun because of their
spontaneous, easygoing view of life, confusing because of their mixed
communication messages. Because ISTPs alternate between enthusiasm
over things of immediate interest to them and quiet reserve about
other things, one can never predict which reaction to expect from
them.

<br/><br/>

ISTPs can often be enigmas, especially to Extraverts and Judgers, who
find their unpredictability and apparent social indifference so
disturbing that they may try to change them. Not only will the ISTP
resent such impositions, ze may get an inner thrill or satisfaction in
not behaving according to expectations, always remaining somewhat
mysterious.

<br/><br/>

ISTPs' nature is to be quietly observing, collecting data on all
things at all times. They do not think of themselves as watching in
order to do something with the information; they are merely scanning
the universe because it is part of their nature to want to take in all
that is occurring. The often dramatic outcome, however, is that when
an emergency occurs, they can move swiftly to the core of the problem
and correct it. What seems like instinctive action is actually the
result of long periods of observation that enabled the ISTP to be
aware of all the details of the picture.

http://webspace.webring.com/people/cl/lifexplore/istp.htm

<br/><br/>

ISTPs are realists who apply expediency and reasoning as they manage
and adapt to situations. They are aware of what is going on in the
environment and are able to respond quickly to the actual facts,
making sure the odds of success are in their favor. They do not like
to be tied down and will feel hamstrung when they must operate within
tight structures and schedules. They are able to anticipate immediate,
practical needs in situations and to present a logical,
straightforward plan for meeting those needs. They are at their best
in situations that require immediate attention.

<br/><br/>

Living

<br/><br/>

ISTP children want life to be logical, flexible and action
oriented. While they like hands-on activities, they also may want to
stand aside and observe what is taking place. They are especially
observant of what makes things tick and may take apart a toy to see
its inner workings. They are curious and are great gatherers of data
and detail. They rarely forget what they have noticed about places and
things. They are aware of flaws and try to correct them. ISTP children
become very absorbed in their hobbies.

<br/><br/>

ISTP teenager may have several close friends but generally are not
social butterflies. They relate to others by sharing detailed
information about one of their interests or sharing in physical
activities that involve a measure of risk. They like sports in which
they can challenge themselves and master specific techniques and
strategies.

<br/><br/>

As young adults, ISTPs tend to follow a path of least resistance when
thinking about their careers. They usually don't like planning ahead
because they think that things don't turn out like the plan. They
relax their brain while everyone else is busy using theirs to plan.

<br/><br/>

ISTPs are pragmatists and gamblers who play each hand as it is
dealt. As a result, they are able to take advantage of opportunities
as they arise. In adult life, ISTPs are fairly laid back and
mellow. They do not impose much structure on themselves or
others. Because they retain and use detail for logical ends, they are
often recognized by their employers as people who do well with the
careful and precise understanding of factual data.

<br/><br/>

Most ISTPs, when questioned about their careers, reveal that they
would love to have more time and income to pursue their interests
full-time. Because retirement may allow ISTPs to further pursue their
work as well as leisure interests unhampered by time demands, it is a
very desirable state for them. If their work is interesting, they may
resist retirement because their work is a key element in their
lives. When their work does not provide them with enough enjoyment and
challenge, they may try to arrange things so that they can retire
early and thus obtain more time to enjoy their leisure pursuits.

<br/><br/>

Learning

<br/><br/>

ISTPs learn best when they can observe first-hand in a one-to-one
situation. They are particularly fond of subjects that have a logical
basis; mastering certain rules or principles allows them to
efficiently work with the subject matter. They like individual
projects that require them to solve problems systematically.

<br/><br/>

ISTPs prefer to learn alone, at their own rate and in their own time
frame. Because they are able to assimilate a great amount of detail in
areas that interest them, they usually do well in those areas. ISTPs
earn their best grades when it is necessary to accurately report facts
and data. They are impatient with theorectical subjects and like their
learning to be directed toward concrete and practical outcomes.

<br/><br/>

Teachers are not particularly important to ISTPs in the overall
scheme, unless they can show ISTPs how to do things more easily. When
the teacher obstructs or gets in the way of something ISTPs want to
learn, they may ignore or go around the teacher. The formal or
traditional school setting is not as important to ISTPs as is the
opportunity to increase their own practical knowledge. Nontraditional
programs or approaches often attract ISTPs, especially when they can
learn about things that they see as vital and central to their
interests.

<br/><br/>

Working

<br/><br/>

At work, ISTPs contribute their realistic and logical way of meeting
situational requirements. They can see the easiest and most expedient
route to completing a task, and they do not waste their effort on
unnecessary things. They often act as trouble shooters, rising to meet
the needs of the occasion. Since many ISTPs have a natural bent in
technical areas, they may often function as 'walking encyclopedias' of
technical information.

<br/><br/>

ISTPs prefer a work setting that is project oriented and unconstrained
by rules. They want a chance to be active, independent problem
solvers. They do not like routing but want the opportunity to be
somewhat inventive in meeting current needs.

<br/><br/>

The ISTP organizing style is based on expediency and quick application
of information. They often organize their hobbies or collections and
make a game of finding the best way to arrange things.

<br/><br/>

ISTPs prefer flexibility and impersonal dealings with others. Because
they often have a technical orientation, they prefer to work in an
environment that produces a practical product. They pay attention to
the organization's hierarchy only to the point of learning how to
bypass or go around it if it stands in their way. ISTPs may have
mastered the details of the organization but may rebel if it is too
rigid.

<br/><br/>

Carpenter, construction worker, dental hygienist, electrical engineer,
farmer, mechanic, military personnel, probation officer, steel worker,
transportation operative, and other occupations that allow them to use
their ability to act expediently are generally attractive to an ISTP.

<br/><br/>

Leading

<br/><br/>

The ISTP leadership style is one of leading through action, by setting
an example. They respond quickly when trouble is at hand. They operate
logically from their internal ruling principles. They give their staff
the necessary information to do their jobs, allowing them to complete
their work in their own fashion. They prefer to be managed loosely and
with minimal supervision, and they manage others in a similar fashion.
 
<br/><br/>

Leisure

<br/><br/>

The opportunity to pursue their interests is very important to
ISTPs. They will do what it takes to have the time and money to
accommodate their leisure-time pursuits. ISTP leisure activities often
have a physical and risk-taking aspect to them. ISTPs get deeply
involved in their activities, adding new ones when boredom sets in,
finding that one interest may lead to another. Often interests begun
in childhood, such as stamp collecting, cooking, and chess, are
maintained throughout their lifetimes. ISTPs retain detail accurately
and often use their spare time to learn more facts.
 
<br/><br/>

Loving

<br/><br/>

For the ISTP, love means being responsive yet realistic. ISTPs seek
partners who either are willing to allow them to have their necessary
freedom or who will participate in these activities with them. They
may introduce their partners to their interests if they are ones that
they want to share. When this is the case, they will acquaint their
loved one with all the facts and details of their interest.

<br/><br/>

When falling in love, ISTPs are very attentive to small things that
might be enjoyed by their partners, surprising them with those
particular gifts. They would rather show their feelings through their
actions than verbalize them. They are not likely to discuss their
feelings about their relationships with their partners because they
believe that the experiences that they have had together will speak
for their feelings. Feelings are discuss only when necessary.

<br/><br/>

When scorned, ISTPs are not likely to share hurt feelings with the
external world. If the couple still has some interests in common,
ISTPs may maintain the relationship with the loved one, but on a
different plane. They do not give up easily on their relationships,
however, unless the weight of the factual evidence convinces them to
do so. When the relationship is actually over, they are usually not
vindictive. They see the end of the relationship as a concrete fact
about which it does little good to worry. They can therefore move on
to new experiences.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

ISTPs are extremely analytical types who are naturally drawn to solving
problems. They are realistic and adaptable and usually accomplish any
task they tackle with great originality and skill. They often have a
droll sense of humour.  

<br/><br/>

ISTPS predominantly use sensing in their external world.  This leads
them to prefer concrete information to abstract ideas or theories.
ISTPs spend quality time observing the world round about them. They
love being outdoors and will often engage others in conversation about
places they have been or the best routes to take from A to B. 

<br/><br/>

ISTPs' first preference is for thinking which they use to run their
interior thought processes. Their sensing comes up with new
information and then their thinking sets about finding new ways to
analyse it. Unlike some of the other thinking types, ISTPs do not use
their thinking to try to control other people or run their outer life.
Indeed ISTPs often have little need to tell people their opinions, let
alone tell them what to do.    

<br/><br/>

ISTPs are very sceptical and take nothing at face value. Indeed they
tend to have a very scientific attitude to life, seeing nothing as the
truth but simply an expedient working hypothesis which will do until
further discoveries are made.  

<br/><br/>

They love finding out how things work and fixing things if they are
broken. This motivation to fix and solve problems leads ISTPs to be
extremely interested in mastering techniques and in using tools. In
fact, of all the types, ISTPs could be described as the “tool
user”. Since it is very important to have the right tool for the job
ISTPs will often acquire an array of tools for anything they are
interested in. This could be for DIY or the right set of golf
clubs. Female ISTPs may express this love of tools in more
conventionally female ways such as kitchen gadgets. At work they may
be particularly interested in different software applications to help
them accomplish tasks.   And, of course, ISTPs often work in jobs like
farming or mechanics which are heavily dependent on tools.  

<br/><br/>

ISTPs, unlike ISTJs, like the unexpected and see life as an
adventure. Naturally curious, ISTPs usually take the view they will
“try anything once.” This viewpoint can be somewhat surprising for
others given ISTPS' naturally sceptical bent.  

<br/><br/>

ISTPs rarely tackle one job at a time and they often won't finish
anything unless they have a deadline. They can work systematically -
e.g. you should see how they eat corn on the cob - but when fixing
things they would prefer just to dive in and start before studying
written instructions. 
 
<br/><br/>

Room for spontaneity and manoeuvre are vitally important to
ISTPs. They cherish their freedom and don't take kindly to being
controlled or overly directed by others. They are great respecters of
other people's freedom and tend not to like telling people what to
do. They often make very laid back, non-directional parents and
managers.  

<br/><br/>

ISTPs, like ESTPs, are exceptionally good in a crisis. In fact they
often end up in troubling shooting roles. It is under pressure that
ISTPs excel in solving problems. They do this by bringing together
their skill in seeing what is needed in the moment with their great
powers of logical analysis.  

<br/><br/>

ISTPs do not like to feel under constant pressure. Of all the types
they seem to operate at two speeds. They can act and think quickly if
they have to, but the rest of the time they can be very laid back and
undertake tasks in a leisurely fashion or not at all. They believe in
economy of effort and may procrastinate. They often have an all or
nothing approach. If they do something it has to perfect but then
again they may not do it till tomorrow.  

<br/><br/>

Their workspaces are often messy though they usually know where things
are.  Another common ISTP trait is finding it difficult to get rid of
things like old magazines or anything which may be handy in the future
and so they tend to be hoarders. 

<br/><br/>

ISTPs, like their fellow type INTPs, may be prone to outbursts of
anger. Outwardly they may appear laid back people but in their head
their thinking is leading them to make continual evaluations and
judgments. However, as introverts, ISTPs don't tend to tell other
people these thoughts until they have stepped over an invisible
line. The ISTPs' annoyance then boils over and they get angry. To
other people this seems to happen out of the blue and it can be a
source of friction in their relationships both at work and at home. 

<br/><br/>

Ultimately it is important for ISTPs to manage their anger
better. They can do this by learning to be more assertive and
expressing their growing displeasure at an earlier stage.  It is also
helpful for them to begin to pay more attention to the importance of
feelings -  their own and others. ISTPs often have to spend quality
time considering what is important for them and what they personally
want to get out of life.

Common relationship Issues for ISTPs

<br/><br/>

ISTPs show caring by fixing things for others when they go wrong and by giving them practical help to solve problems. 

<br/><br/>

ISTPs like others to respect their need for privacy and
concentration. This often means not interrupting what they are doing. 

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

ISTP - Quiet, Practical, Logical, Flexible

<br/><br/>

Introvert - Sensing - Thinking - Perceiving

<br/><br/>

ISTPs like to observe and then act. They have a "no nonsense" kind of
realism. They are good at dealing with lots of data and practical
solution oriented problems. Efficiency and economy of effort is
important. They don't act until it is necessary to do so. 

<br/><br/>

They are independent, tolerant and flexible. The Thinking part makes
them more logical than artistic. The Perceiving part leads to a more
passive, flexible approach. 

<br/><br/>

They dislike conversation, authority, rules and structured traditional
organizational forms. They can enjoy high-risk activities like racing
and extreme sports, and are very in tune with their bodies and
kinesthetic capabilities (like fine motor skills)

<br/><br/>

Most Developed Skill

<br/><br/>

The drive is to make logical decisions. Detached reflection makes for
great observation skills. This makes them critical but curious,
analytical yet imaginative, efficient and down to earth.

<br/><br/>

Strengths

<br/><br/>

Their strengths lie in their ability to seize opportunities, take
action, risk, and improvise to bring projects into the world. They are
good at crisis management of practical problems. Loyalty and
commitment is strong.

<br/><br/>

Skills

<br/><br/>

ISTPs dominant skill is analytical, mechanical ability - understanding
the principles of things (as opposed to ideas and concepts). They work
well with tools and their hands. They have excellent observation and
memory for facts. They stay calm under pressure and crisis.

<br/><br/>

Weaknesses

<br/><br/>

They can become irresponsible, childish, and unreliable. The Sensing
Perceiving combination can make them act without thinking things
through.

<br/><br/>

They can be blunt and insensitive about the feelings of others. They
are impatient with theories and abstract ideas. They dislike
administrative details and procedures.

<br/><br/>

Stress Response

<br/><br/>

Under stress, they can be rebellious, defensive, restless,
unscrupulous, mercenary and rigid.

<br/><br/>

Typical Expression

<br/><br/>

ISTPs typical form of expression is as specific, practical observers
and organizers of data and facts. They can appear impassive and
uninvolved until something motivates their practical problem solving
bent. They appear as no nonsense realists to others.

<br/><br/>

Values

<br/><br/>

ISTPs value skeptical thorough analysis and efficiency.

<br/><br/>

Need

<br/><br/>

They have high need for autonomy, variety and action. They need
uninterrupted time and independence. They don't like procedures,
structure and repetition.

<br/><br/>

Learning

<br/><br/>

The Sensing Perceiving combination learns best through
experience. Abstractions and theories seem complicated and
tedious. They need to live their experiences, not talk about
them. They are good at hands on skill development - honing skills
through practice.

<br/><br/>

Least Developed Skills

<br/><br/>

Their least developed skill is extraverted feeling. This
underdevelopment shows itself in a driving need to be liked and
appreciated. They can overwhelm others with affection trying to get
this.

<br/><br/>

The lack of development of this mode makes the effective control and
use of passion and powerful emotions difficult. Learning
interdependence with people and experiencing and expressing emotion
can greatly increase their quality and enjoyment of life.

<br/><br/>

What's it like to be you?

<br/><br/>

Inside I am continually reworking an issue. I am constantly open to
new directions, always tweaking and bringing in new information. I
solve a problem by looking at all the angles, probably whatever side I
need to. There is an answer, and I just need to get to the best way to
figure it out-to meet my objectives and give it to people how it is
without annoying anyone.

<br/><br/>

To work with difficult situations I become very logical and very
analytical, and I look to see where things fit. I always watch and if
there's a problem, I go back inside myself to see what may need to be
done and how best to approach a situation. I like to find a technique.

<br/><br/>

The observational part of me is the ability to see when an opportunity
exists and to actually act on it and make things a little bit
better. I like to choose the timing for when it's appropriate to say
or do something. I spend a lot of time considering scenarios before I
make decisions. I'll usually go with a hunch, my intuition, what's the
most likely cause. I do my best problem solving in my head away from
whatever it is. I step back outside of things, think for a while, and
make adjustments-could this be better than that, how do these react,
and how does the whole system go together? I'm willing to do the
upfront work, which makes it expedient because I never have to repeat
it. 

<br/><br/>

In my work, I don't want to be just doing stuff for the sake of doing
stuff. I like to accomplish things-make a contribution. That's real
important. I take a "do it" type of approach. It's very
practical. It's very here and now. That does not mean I don't take
into consideration the big picture and what's down the road and what's
best for the organization, but at the same time my big focus is "let's
get this show on the road and let's do it." I do it as well as I
can. Then I think very well on my feet. I can be quick with the verbal
comeback-I like the impact. I just get in there and do it, and
whatever job I go into, I hit the ground running. And I'm very
competitive, often with myself. I tie one hand behind my back and see
if I can still do it...

<br/><br/>

I like flexibility in what I do. Fun means something that interests
me. Organized things don't come to me easily, but I can do them. I've
always found ways to make things fun. It's a game to make sure you can
come to the next point where you have freedom again There's something
insincere about doing something just because of somebody or something
else. What I do has to make sense, have impact. I cannot stand just
busy work. It has to be meaningful. I have an incredible amount of
enthusiasm and passion for certain things that I do and want to see
done.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

ISTPs are quite low-key when it comes to every day living, but when a
project they like comes along, they launch into a frenzy of activity
that is actually more organized then it appears. Ps are performers at
heart and ISTPs have interests that lie more toward mechanical areas
rather then artistic. Some ISTPs will choose a friend or relative as
their next "project" and they are said to be quite overbearing when
this happens. ISTPs need to "spread out" in the physical and the
psychological sense; they need their space and can sometimes be quite
unforgiving in taking it. Those who invest their time in a
relationship with an ISPT may be hurt by this behaviour as they may
withdraw and become "loners" for a while with no explanation; or they
may encroach on another's space without regard for their needs.

<br/><br/>

Since ISTPs need this space in their life to do as they please when
they please, they tend to be generally quite inflexible when someone
tries to alter their lifestyle in any way. ISTPs are known to get
quite angry with anyone who tries to do this, and it is quite a
contrast to their usual withdrawn nature. Due to this, communication
is vastly important in any relationship with an ISTP, although they
prefer to relate their feelings non-verbally which indicates
activation in the amygdala, the emotional control centre.
<br/><br/>

ISTPs are more "left brain" as they tend to gravitate towards skilled
trades and engineering; they tend to dislike abstract thinking and
don't do well in these classes, which are actually not indicative of
their intelligence. As emergency workers such as firefighters and
paramedics, ISTPs thrive because of their natural disregard for
authority figures and structured rules; this mean they can handle the
situation quickly and efficiently without needing to double-check with
anyone else first. ISTPs are independent at heart and need to follow
their own path; they dislike taking orders and will often retaliate
with more of their own if that's the case. If an ISTP should take on a
career that involves minimal risk, they will usually make up for that
in their personal life by doing extreme sports. This suggests that
this type seeks out extra stimulation of the cortex since dangerous
activities elevate their level of arousal.

<br/><br/>

http://www.123test.com/ISTP-personality-type/

<br/><br/>

An ISTP at-a-glance

<br/><br/>

Let's do it - get it done now! could easily be your motto and
description of your philosophy of life. You are very practical and
action-orientated. You focus your energy at work and play on things
that can be done and experienced now. Not next week... not next
month. Action nourishes and sustains you, and you need it to thrive.

<br/><br/>

You are competitive, self-sufficient and able to function without
needing to rely on support and encouragement from others. People who
know you well are likely to describe you as intriguing, optimistic and
loyal. The sort of person who lives in the here-and-now rather than in
the past or future. People who do not know you well may see you as
being rather reserved - perhaps shy. However, friends are likely to
see you as a free spirit with an attractive quiet charm.

<br/>
ISTP Credo: "You stay off my back, I’ll stay off yours!"

<br/>
<br/>
ISTP Keywords: Pragmatic, Strong-willed, Difficult-to-know,
Knowledge-store, Expedient, Independent, Persuasive, Practical
Watchful, Resourceful, Flexible, Action-oriented, Bursts of energy

<br/>
<br/>
The ISTP is one of the most complex of Jungian character types moving
seamlessly from quiet bystander to active participant and leader of
the revolution in one fell swoop, then back again to invisible,
apparently disinterested introvert. The self-indulgent nature of the
ISTP means that they will be full-on, or full off - they don’t do
shades of grey! The ISTP is at their best in times of crisis and
challenge, but will have little appetite for
follow-through. Independent, inscrutable and self-contained the ISTP
will be difficult to get to know as they will reveal only what they
choose to reveal.

<br/>
<br/>
Practical, resourceful, adaptable pragmatists, ISTPs possess an
excellent capacity for understanding how anything works, displaying
logical, detached analysis. They have incredible (often understated),
powers of observation and a great talent for logical dispassionate
analysis, and getting things to work. Since people rarely conform to
laws of physics the ISTP may struggle with interpersonal issues
preferring the rationality of scientific experiments to the
irrationality of mere mortals with all their foibles, idiosyncrasies
and irrationality. They will also be quite private regarding their own
personal lives and walk away from conflict, not from fear but as it is
just so unproductive! However this means that others may therefore see
them as thick-skinned and uncaring.

<br/>
<br/>
Practical, pragmatic and realistic the ISTP is self-sufficient and
very independent, only really happy when undertaking some risky or
interesting activity. Direct to the point of abruptness and tending at
times to tread on toes, the ISTP tends to speak literally showing
little concern for the impact, and they display coolness under
pressure which helps get things fixed but which may not endear them to
those around them, (even those for whom they’ve fixed something!) 

<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately the ISTP wants to be left alone to live their lives and do
their jobs the way they see fit, rarely trying to control others and
expecting others not to try to control them. But in a crisis, or when
the situation needs in-depth understanding, the ISTP will thrive - at
least until the crisis is over! 

<br/>
<br/>
An ISTP will be difficult to know as they will be quiet outsiders
looking in until they are ready. One they are clear on what needs to
be done, they will, paradoxically, be difficult to budge and will
potentially move too quickly without thinking through all the
implications. 

<br/>
<br/>
The ISTP is either full on or apparently full off, and this may
confuse those with whom they work. They dislike theories and
complexities, preferring facts and data which will help get the job
done in the quickest possible time and with the minimum amount of
effort. The critical faculty of the ISTP can appear cynical or
negative, as they watch from the side-lines. 

<br/>
<br/>
Others may be taken by surprise by someone who has simply observed and
pointed out the down-side who then suddenly becomes animated,
energetic and who makes decisions based on logic rather than peoples'
feelings. The switch may appear as from someone who is almost
exclusively listening to someone who just doesn't listen! 
<br/>
<br/>

The ISTP has a great ability to analyse facts and store data. This is
all internalised, stored in the grey filing cabinets in the brain
until called for. Then, when someone argues with the ISTP, the facts,
data, empirical evidence, knowledge are brought quickly to bear to
quash the arguments. 

<br/>
<br/>
If an ISTP is not in a position where they can make such full-on
contributions, they can sit back and criticise, citing many rational
reasons as to why they are right and the existing methods are wrong. 

<br/>
<br/>
The independent streak in the ISTP means that they will usually
display confidence in their own abilities but this means they may also
not bring others into the decision-making process. Their desire to get
a result in the minimum amount of time also means they may overlook
the personal touch, and make them fail to see the 'bigger picture,'
and so, by quickly solving a problem, they may create another. 

<br/>
<br/>
The ISTP is VERY difficult to know and an unusual character type. Like
their fellow SPs, ISTPs are fundamentally performers ‘T’s their areas
of interest tend to be mechanical and physical rather than artistic
like those of ISFPs, and unlike most ESPs they do not present an
impression of constant activity. On the contrary, they can lie quite
dormant, storing all the data and information in the grey filing
cabinets, saving their energy until a project or an adventure they
deem worthy of their time arises, and then they launch themselves into
this headlong and full throttle.
