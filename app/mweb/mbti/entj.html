<h3>ENTJ</h3>

<br/>

"I don't care to sit by the window on an airplane. If I can't control it, why
look?"

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs have a natural tendency to marshall and direct. This may be expressed with
the charm and finesse of a world leader or with the insensitivity of a cult
leader. The ENTJ requires little encouragement to make a plan. One ENTJ put it
this way... "I make these little plans that really don't have any importance to
anyone else, and then feel compelled to carry them out." While "compelled" may
not describe ENTJs as a group, nevertheless the bent to plan creatively and to
make those plans reality is a common theme for NJ types.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs are often "larger than life" in describing their projects or
proposals. This ability may be expressed as salesmanship, story-telling facility
or stand-up comedy. In combination with the natural propensity for filibuster,
our hero can make it very difficult for the customer to decline.

<br/>
<br/>

TRADEMARK: -- "I'm really sorry you have to die." (I realize this is an
overstatement. However, most Fs and other gentle souls usually chuckle knowingly
at this description.)

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs are decisive. They see what needs to be done, and frequently assign roles
to their fellows. Few other types can equal their ability to remain resolute in
conflict, sending the valiant (and often leading the charge) into the mouth of
hell. When challenged, the ENTJ may by reflex become
argumentative. Alternatively (s)he may unleash an icy gaze that serves notice:
the ENTJ is not one to be trifled with.

<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

"Unequivocating" expresses the resoluteness of the ENTJ's dominant
function. Clarity of convictions endows these Thinkers with a knack for debate,
or wanting knack, a penchant for argument. The light and heat generated by
Thinking at the helm can be impressive; perhaps even overwhelming. Experience
teaches many ENTJs that restraint may often be the better part of valor, lest
one find oneself victorious but alone.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

The auxiliary function explores the blueprints of archetypal patterns and equips
Thinking with a fresh, dynamic sense of how things work. Improvising on the fly
is something many ENTJs do very well. As Thinking's subordinate, insights are of
value only insofar as they further the Right, True Cause celebre. [n.b.: ENTJs
are capable of living on a higher plane, if you will, and learning to value
individuals even above their principles. The above dynamic suggests less
individuation.]

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

Sensing reaches out to embrace that which physically touches it. ENTJs have an
awareness of the real; of that which exists. By stilling the engines of Thinking
and iNtuition, this type may experience the Here and Now, and know things not
dreamt of nor even postulated in iNtuition's philosophy. Sensing's minor role,
however, puts it at risk for distortion or extreme weakness beneath the hustle
and bustle of the giants N and T.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

Feeling is romantic, as the ethereal as the inner world from whence it doth
emerge. When it be awake, feeling evokes great passion that knows not nuance of
proportion nor context. Perhaps these lesser functions inspire glorious
recreational quests in worlds that never were, or may only ever be in
fantasy. When overdone or taken too seriously, Fi turned outward often becomes
maudlin or melodramatic. Feeling in this type appears most authentic when
implied or expressed covertly in a firm handshake, accepting demeanor, or act of
sacrifice thinly covered by excuses of lack of any personal interest in the
relinquished item.

The Executive

<br/>
<br/>

As an ENTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal
with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you
take things in primarily via your intuition.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs are natural born leaders. They live in a world of possibilities where they
see all sorts challenges to be surmounted, and they want to be the ones
responsible for surmounting them. They have a drive for leadership, which is
well-served by their quickness to grasp complexities, their ability to absorb a
large amount of impersonal information, and their quick and decisive
judgments. They are "take charge" people.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs are very career-focused, and fit into the corporate world quite
naturally. They are constantly scanning their environment for potential problems
which they can turn into solutions. They generally see things from a long-range
perspective, and are usually successful at identifying plans to turn problems
around - especially problems of a corporate nature. ENTJs are usually successful
in the business world, because they are so driven to leadership. They're
tireless in their efforts on the job, and driven to visualize where an
organization is headed. For these reasons, they are natural corporate leaders.

<br/>
<br/>

There is not much room for error in the world of the ENTJ. They dislike to see
mistakes repeated, and have no patience with inefficiency. They may become quite
harsh when their patience is tried in these respects, because they are not
naturally tuned in to people's feelings, and more than likely don't believe that
they should tailor their judgments in consideration for people's
feelings. ENTJs, like many types, have difficulty seeing things from outside
their own perspective. Unlike other types, ENTJs naturally have little patience
with people who do not see things the same way as the ENTJ. The ENTJ needs to
consciously work on recognizing the value of other people's opinions, as well as
the value of being sensitive towards people's feelings. In the absence of this
awareness, the ENTJ will be a forceful, intimidating and overbearing
individual. This may be a real problem for the ENTJ, who may be deprived of
important information and collaboration from others. In their personal world, it
can make some ENTJs overbearing as spouses or parents.

<br/>
<br/>

The ENTJ has a tremendous amount of personal power and presence which will work
for them as a force towards achieving their goals. However, this personal power
is also an agent of alienation and self-aggrandizement, which the ENTJ would do
well to avoid.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs are very forceful, decisive individuals. They make decisions quickly, and
are quick to verbalize their opinions and decisions to the rest of the
world. The ENTJ who has not developed their Intuition will make decisions too
hastily, without understanding all of the issues and possible solutions. On the
other hand, an ENTJ who has not developed their Thinking side will have
difficulty applying logic to their insights, and will often make poor
decisions. In that case, they may have brilliant ideas and insight into
situations, but they may have little skill at determining how to act upon their
understanding, or their actions may be inconsistent. An ENTJ who has developed
in a generally less than ideal way may become dictatorial and abrasive -
intrusively giving orders and direction without a sound reason for doing so, and
without consideration for the people involved.

<br/>
<br/>

Although ENTJs are not naturally tuned into other people's feelings, these
individuals frequently have very strong sentimental streaks. Often these
sentiments are very powerful to the ENTJ, although they will likely hide it from
general knowledge, believing the feelings to be a weakness. Because the world of
feelings and values is not where the ENTJ naturally functions, they may
sometimes make value judgments and hold onto submerged emotions which are
ill-founded and inappropriate, and will cause them problems - sometimes rather
serious problems.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs love to interact with people. As Extroverts, they're energized and
stimulated primarily externally. There's nothing more enjoyable and satisfying
to the ENTJ than having a lively, challenging conversation. They especially
respect people who are able to stand up to the ENTJ, and argue persuasively for
their point of view. There aren't too many people who will do so, however,
because the ENTJ is a very forceful and dynamic presence who has a tremendous
amount of self-confidence and excellent verbal communication skills. Even the
most confident individuals may experience moments of self-doubt when debating a
point with an ENTJ.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs want their home to be beautiful, well-furnished, and efficiently
run. They're likely to place much emphasis on their children being well-educated
and structured, to desire a congenial and devoted relationship with their
spouse. At home, the ENTJ needs to be in charge as much as he or she does in
their career. The ENTJ is likely best paired with someone who has a strong
self-image, who is also a Thinking type. Because the ENTJ is primarily focused
on their careers, some ENTJs have a problem with being constantly absent from
home, physically or mentally.

<br/>
<br/>

The ENTJ has many gifts which make it possible for them to have a great deal of
personal power, if they don't forget to remain balanced in their lives. The are
assertive, innovative, long-range thinkers with an excellent ability to
translate theories and possibilities into solid plans of action. They are
usually tremendously forceful personalities, and have the tools to accomplish
whatever goals they set out for.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENTJ

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ENTJs as Fieldmarshals, one of the four types belonging to
the temperament he called the Rationals.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs are among the rarest of types, accounting for about 2-5% of those who are
formally tested.[2][3] They tend to be self-driven, motivating, energetic,
assertive, confident, and competitive. They generally take a big-picture view
and build a long-term strategy. They typically know what they want and may
mobilize others to help them attain their goals. ENTJs are often sought out as
leaders due to an innate ability to direct groups of people. Unusually
influential and organized, they may sometimes judge others by their own tough
standards, failing to take personal needs into account.[4]

<br/>
<br/>

* E - Extraversion preferred to introversion: ENTJs often feel motivated by
  their interaction with people. They tend to enjoy a wide circle of
  acquaintances, and they gain energy in social situations (whereas introverts
  expend energy).[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* N - Intuition preferred to sensing: ENTJs tend to be more abstract than
  concrete. They focus their attention on the big picture rather than the
  details, and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities.[7] They
  tend to focus on the final product rather than the current task.
  
<br/>
<br/>

* T - Thinking preferred to feeling: ENTJs tend to value objective criteria
  above personal preference. When making decisions, they generally give more
  weight to logic than to social considerations.[8]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* J - Judgment preferred to perception: ENTJs tend to plan their activities and
  make decisions early. They derive a sense of control through predictability,
  which to perceptive types may seem limiting.[9] ENTJs often try to predict
  outcomes and plan accordingly.
  
<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs have a natural tendency to marshal and direct. This may be expressed with
the charm and finesse of a world leader or with the insensitivity of a cult
leader. The ENTJ requires little encouragement to make a plan. One ENTJ put it
this way... "I make these little plans that really don't have any importance to
anyone else, and then feel compelled to carry them out." While "compelled" may
not describe ENTJs as a group, nevertheless the bent to plan creatively and to
make those plans reality is a common theme for NJ types. [11]

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs focus on the most efficient and organized means of performing a task. This
quality, along with their goal orientation, often makes ENTJs superior leaders,
both realistic and visionary in implementing a long-term plan. ENTJs tend to be
fiercely independent in their decision making, having a strong will that
insulates them against external influence. Generally highly competent, ENTJs
analyze and structure the world around them in a logical and rational way. Due
to this straightforward way of thinking, ENTJs tend to have the greatest
difficulty of all the types in applying subjective considerations and emotional
values into the decision-making process.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs often excel in business and other areas that require systems analysis,
original thinking, and an economically savvy mind. They are dynamic and
pragmatic problem solvers. They tend to have a high degree of confidence in
their own abilities, making them assertive and outspoken. In their dealings with
others, they are generally outgoing, charismatic, fair-minded, and unaffected by
conflict or criticism. However, these qualities can make ENTJs appear arrogant,
insensitive, and confrontational. They can overwhelm others with their energy,
intelligence, and desire to order the world according to their own vision. As a
result, they may seem intimidating, hasty, and controlling.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTJs tend to cultivate their personal power. They often end up taking charge of
a situation that seems (to their mind, at least) to be out of control, or that
can otherwise be improved upon and strengthened. They strive to learn new
things, which helps them become resourceful problem-solvers. However, since
ENTJs rely on provable facts, they may find subjective issues pointless. ENTJs
appear to take a tough approach to emotional or personal issues, and so can be
viewed as aloof and insensitive. In situations requiring feeling and value
judgments, ENTJs are well served to seek the advice of a trusted Feeling type.

<br/>
<br/>

When striving toward a goal, ENTJs often put personal needs aside until the work
is done (and may expect others to do the same).[12] For this reason, ENTJs may
be considered self-sacrificing by some,[citation needed] but "cold and
heartless"[8] by others, especially those who prefer Feeling.

<br/>
<br/>

Notable ENTJs

<br/>
<br/>

According to David Keirsey, based on observations of behavior, notable ENTJs
might include Napoleon Bonaparte, Margaret Thatcher, Steve Jobs, Golda Meir,and
Bill Gates.[2] For a more complete list, see Notable Fieldmarshals.

<br/>
<br/>

Correlation with Enneatype

<br/>
<br/>

According to Baron and Wagele, the most common Enneatypes for ENTJs are Achievers (Three), Skeptics (Six, also known as The Loyalist) and Asserters (Eight, also known as The Challenger).[13]

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functions (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) form a
hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's so-called default pattern of
behavior.

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information gathering
function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making function
(thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less developed
than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding out the
person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's Achilles'
heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the Tertiary,
the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[14]

<br/>
<br/>

Jung and Myers considered the attitude of the Auxiliary, Tertiary, and Inferior
functions to be the opposite of the Dominant. In this interpretation, if the
Dominant function is extraverted, then the other three are introverted, and vice
versa. However, many modern practitioners hold that the attitude of the Tertiary
function is the same as the Dominant.[5] Using the more modern interpretation,
the cognitive functions of the ENTJ are as follows:[14]

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Extraverted thinking (Te)

<br/>
<br/>

Te organizes and schedules ideas and the environment to ensure the efficient,
productive pursuit of objectives. Te seeks logical explanations for actions,
events, and conclusions, looking for faulty reasoning and lapses in
sequence. [15]

<br/>
<br/>

Te is the most developed function for ENTJs. Te involves ordering, structuring,
specifying, and applying logic to situations. ENTJs tend to be endowed with
strong organizational and coordination skills. Te is also focused on performing
a task in the most efficient and productive manner, which generally gives ENTJs
the ability to direct and marshal their environment according to work-specific
needs. Further, Te contributes to the ENTJs' ability to accumulate relevant data
while analyzing that data for factual accuracies and impersonal applications.

<br/>
<br/>

Auxiliary: Introverted intuition (Ni)

<br/>
<br/>

Attracted to symbolic actions or devices, Ni synthesizes seeming paradoxes to
create the previously unimagined. These realizations come with a certainty that
demands action to fulfill a new vision of the future, solutions that may include
complex systems or universal truths. [16]

<br/>
<br/>

Ni allows ENTJs to process information and events through impressions,
possibilities, and meanings, thereby helping provide ENTJs with a sense of the
future. Ni contributes to the ability to grasp patterns and plans. Complex,
generalized information is processed through Ni to add clarity and check for
imperfections. Ni supports Te in ENTJs' pursuit of goals; ENTJs use Ni to
improve a situation to make it more useful to themselves.

<br/>
<br/>

Tertiary: Extraverted sensing (Se)

<br/>
<br/>

Se focuses on the experiences and sensations of the immediate, physical
world. With an acute awareness of the present surroundings, it brings relevant
facts and details to the forefront and may lead to spontaneous action. [17]

<br/>
<br/>

In ENTJs, Se is a basic function, less developed than Te or Ni. Se helps ENTJs
effectively act upon their immediate surroundings. ENTJs scan their physical
environment to observe where improvements can be made, and Se is integral to the
application of Te and Ni to meet those standards. Se gathers detailed data from
the immediate experience to expand the ENTJs' knowledge base and heighten the
ENTJs' sense of reality upon taking action.

<br/>
<br/>

Inferior: Introverted feeling (Fi)

<br/>
<br/>

Fi filters information based on interpretations of worth, forming judgments
according to criteria that are often intangible. Fi constantly balances an
internal set of values such as harmony and authenticity. Attuned to subtle
distinctions, Fi innately senses what is true and what is false in a
situation. [18]

<br/>
<br/>

Fi is the ENTJs' weakest function, but it does mature over time. ENTJs have
difficulty applying subjective and emotional thoughts to their decision-making,
since they believe Feeling obstructs decisiveness and impartiality. While this
is applicable to objective criteria, ENTJs must learn to recognize the great
importance of Feeling in relationships and personal contact, since it creates
the close bonds vital to human beings. At worst, a failure to engage the Feeling
function can make ENTJs appear overbearing, insensitive, and abrasive. Further,
it can result in an underdeveloped system of morality and values, which can
disengage ENTJs from the personal world of self-fulfillment.

<br/>
<br/>

Shadow functions

<br/>
<br/>

Later personality researchers (notably Linda V. Berens)[19] added four additional functions to the descending hierarchy, the so-called "shadow" functions to which the individual is not naturally inclined but which can be developed, or emerge when the person is under stress. The shadow processes "operate more on the boundaries of our awareness…We usually experience these processes in a negative way, yet when we are open to them, they can be quite positive."[20] For the ENTJ these shadow functions are (in order):

<br/>
<br/>

* Introverted thinking (Ti): Ti seeks precision, such as the exact word to
  express an idea. It notices the minute distinctions that define the essence of
  things, then analyzes and classifies them. Ti examines all sides of an issue,
  looking to solve problems while minimizing effort and risk. It uses models to
  root out logical inconsistency.[21] For the ENTJ, Ti supports Te by expanding
  the use of the Thinking function. But using Ti requires more effort, and Ti's
  application is narrower.
  
<br/>
<br/>

* Extraverted intuition (Ne): Ne finds and interprets hidden meanings, using
  "what if" questions to explore alternatives and allowing multiple
  possibilities to coexist. This imaginative play weaves together insights and
  experiences from various sources to form a new whole, which can then become a
  catalyst to action.[22] For the ENTJ, Ne can connect and generate ideas,
  adding breadth to the intuitive process of Ni. In its negative form Ne has a
  critical element that may lead to actions that demoralize or immobilize
  others.
  
<br/>
<br/>

* Introverted sensing (Si): Si collects data in the present moment and compares
  it with past experiences. This process sometimes evokes the feelings
  associated with memory as if the subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect
  what is familiar, Si draws upon history to form goals and expectations about
  what will happen in the future.[23] For the ENTJ, Si can provide practical
  guidance and comic insight into bothersome or tiring situations that stress an
  otherwise stable ENTJ. However, neglect of Si can lead to careless and hasty
  behavior in detail-oriented tasks.
  
<br/>
<br/>

* Extraverted feeling (Fe): Fe seeks social connections and creates harmonious
  interactions through polite, considerate, and appropriate behavior. Fe
  responds to the explicit (and implicit) wants of others, and may even create
  an internal conflict between the subject’s own needs and the desire to meet
  the needs of others.[24] For the ENTJ, the Fe function lacks proper
  acknowledgment much like the inferior Fi counterpart. Over the long term, Fe
  will balance the awareness that ENTJs have of themselves and others by
  dampening the excessive effects of the dominant Te function.
