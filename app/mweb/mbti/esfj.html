<h3>ESFJ</h3>

http://typelogic.com/esfj.html

<br/>
<br/>

Guardians of birthdays, holidays and celebrations, ESFJs are generous
entertainers. They enjoy and joyfully observe traditions and are liberal in
giving, especially where custom prescribes.

<br/>
<br/>

All else being equal, ESFJs enjoy being in charge. They see problems clearly and
delegate easily, work hard and play with zest. ESFJs, as do most SJs, bear
strong allegiance to rights of seniority. They willingly provide service (which
embodies life's meaning) and expect the same from others.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs are easily wounded. And when wounded, their emotions will not be
contained. They by nature "wear their hearts on their sleeves," often exuding
warmth and bonhomie, but not infrequently boiling over with the vexation of
their souls. Some ESFJs channel these vibrant emotions into moving dramatic
performances on stage and screen.

<br/>
<br/>

Strong, contradictory forces consume the ESFJ. Their sense of right and wrong
wrestles with an overwhelming rescuing, 'mothering' drive. This sometimes
results in swift, immediate action taken upon a transgressor, followed by stern
reprimand; ultimately, however, the prodigal is wrested from the gallows of
their folly, just as the noose tightens and all hope is lost, by the very
executioner!

<br/>
<br/>

An ESFJ at odds with self is a remarkable sight. When a decision must be made,
especially one involving the risk of conflict (abhorrent to ESFJs), there ensues
an in-house wrestling match between the aforementioned black-and-white Values
and the Nemesis of Discord. The contender pits self against self, once firmly
deciding with the Right, then switching to Prudence to forestall hostilities,
countered by unswerving Values, ad exhaustium, winner take all.

<br/>
<br/>

As caretakers, ESFJs sense danger all around--germs within, the elements
without, unscrupulous malefactors, insidious character flaws. The world is a
dangerous place, not to be trusted. Not that the ESFJ is paranoid;
'hyper-vigilant' would be more precise. And thus they serve excellently as
protectors, outstanding in fields such as medical care and elementary education.

<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis:

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs live in their Extraverted Feeling functioning. Feeling, a rational (i.e.,
deciding) function, expresses opinions easily in the E world of objects and
people. ESFJs have the ability to express warmth, rage, and a range of other
emotions. Actions are encouraged or rebuked based on how they affect other
people, especially people near and dear to the ESFJ. This type's vocal
decisiveness predisposes many of its number to facility with administration and
supervision.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

The secondary Sensing function aids and abets the dominant Fe in that sensate
data is collected and at once compared with the inner forms or standards. Data
on which decisions are made are thus focused and given a contrast which tends to
be stronger and clearer than the original stimuli. The strengthening effect of
Si on Fe may be responsible for this type's reputation for wearing their "hearts
on their sleeves." At any rate, ESFJs reflect the "black and white" view of
reality which is common to the SJ types.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

Intuition is tertiary--as the ESFJ matures, and as situations arise which call
for suspension of criticism, Ne is allowed to play. Under the leadership of the
Fe function, iNtuition allows for a loosening of the more rigid Si rights and
wrongs; teasing and slapstick humor emerge. ESFJs are also capable of discerning
patterns and philosophies, but such perceiving is subject to the weakness of the
tertiary position, and the results often lack the variety and complexity of
connections that more complex systems require.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

The inferior Ti function may rarely be expressed. In fact, ESFJs may take
affront at the aloof, detached nature of dominant Ti types, or conversely, be
drawn to them. Some ESFJs construct rationale which have the appearance of
(Jungian) Thinking logic, but under scrutiny are in fact command performances of
"Thinking in the service of Feeling," (i.e., Thinking-like conclusions which do
not obey the tenets of impersonal logic; they rather construct scenarios from
only those "hard, cold facts" which support the conclusion reached by the
dominant Extraverted Feeling function. To wit:

The Caregiver

<br/>
<br/>

As an ESFJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal
with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your
personal value system. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in
via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs are people persons - they love people. They are warmly interested in
others. They use their Sensing and Judging characteristics to gather specific,
detailed information about others, and turn this information into supportive
judgments. They want to like people, and have a special skill at bringing out
the best in others. They are extremely good at reading others, and understanding
their point of view. The ESFJ's strong desire to be liked and for everything to
be pleasant makes them highly supportive of others. People like to be around
ESFJs, because the ESFJ has a special gift of invariably making people feel good
about themselves.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESFJ takes their responsibilities very seriously, and is very
dependable. They value security and stability, and have a strong focus on the
details of life. They see before others do what needs to be done, and do
whatever it takes to make sure that it gets done. They enjoy these types of
tasks, and are extremely good at them.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs are warm and energetic. They need approval from others to feel good about
themselves. They are hurt by indifference and don't understand unkindness. They
are very giving people, who get a lot of their personal satisfaction from the
happiness of others. They want to be appreciated for who they are, and what they
give. They're very sensitive to others, and freely give practical care. ESFJs
are such caring individuals, that they sometimes have a hard time seeing or
accepting a difficult truth about someone they care about.

<br/>
<br/>

With Extraverted Feeling dominating their personality, ESFJs are focused on
reading other people. They have a strong need to be liked, and to be in
control. They are extremely good at reading others, and often change their own
manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're with at the moment.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESFJ's value system is defined externally. They usually have very
well-formed ideas about the way things should be, and are not shy about
expressing these opinions. However, they weigh their values and morals against
the world around them, rather than against an internal value system. They may
have a strong moral code, but it is defined by the community that they live in,
rather than by any strongly felt internal values.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs who have had the benefit of being raised and surrounded by a strong value
system that is ethical and centered around genuine goodness will most likely be
the kindest, most generous souls who will gladly give you the shirt off of their
back without a second thought. For these individuals, the selfless quality of
their personality type is genuine and pure. ESFJs who have not had the advantage
of developing their own values by weighing them against a good external value
system may develop very questionable values. In such cases, the ESFJ most often
genuinely believes in the integrity of their skewed value system. They have no
internal understanding of values to set them straight. In weighing their values
against our society, they find plenty of support for whatever moral
transgression they wish to justify. This type of ESFJ is a dangerous person
indeed. Extraverted Feeling drives them to control and manipulate, and their
lack of Intuition prevents them from seeing the big picture. They're usually
quite popular and good with people, and good at manipulating them. Unlike their
ENFJ cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them understand the real
consequences of their actions. They are driven to manipulate other to achieve
their own ends, yet they believe that they are following a solid moral code of
conduct.

<br/>
<br/>

All ESFJs have a natural tendency to want to control their environment. Their
dominant function demands structure and organization, and seeks closure. ESFJs
are most comfortable with structured environments. They're not likely to enjoy
having to do things which involve abstract, theoretical concepts, or impersonal
analysis. They do enjoy creating order and structure, and are very good at tasks
which require these kinds of skills. ESFJs should be careful about controling
people in their lives who do not wish to be controlled.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs respect and believe in the laws and rules of authority, and believe that
others should do so as well. They're traditional, and prefer to do things in the
established way, rather than venturing into unchartered territory. Their need
for security drives their ready acceptance and adherence to the policies of the
established system. This tendency may cause them to sometimes blindly accept
rules without questioning or understanding them.

<br/>
<br/>

An ESFJ who has developed in a less than ideal way may be prone to being quite
insecure, and focus all of their attention on pleasing others. He or she might
also be very controling, or overly sensitive, imagining bad intentions when
there weren't any.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs incorporate many of the traits that are associated with women in our
society. However, male ESFJs will usually not appear feminine at all. On the
contrary, ESFJs are typically quite conscious about gender roles and will be
most comfortable playing a role that suits their gender in our society. Male
ESFJs will be quite masculine (albeit sensitive when you get to know them), and
female ESFJs will be very feminine.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs at their best are warm, sympathetic, helpful, cooperative, tactful,
down-to-earth, practical, thorough, consistent, organized, enthusiastic, and
energetic. They enjoy tradition and security, and will seek stable lives that
are rich in contact with friends and family.

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Extraverted Feeling
<br/>
Auxiliary: Introverted Sensing
<br/>
Tertiary: Extraverted Intuition
<br/>
Inferior: Introverted Thinking

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESFJ

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ESFJs as Providers, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Guardians. ESFJs account for about 9-13% of the
population.[2][3]

<br/>
<br/>

* E - Extraversion preferred to introversion: ESFJs often feel motivated by their interaction with people. They tend to enjoy a wide circle of acquaintances, and they gain energy in social situations (whereas introverts expend energy).[6]
<br/>
<br/>

* S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ESFJs tend to be more concrete than abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than the big picture, and on immediate realities rather than future possibilities .[7]
<br/>
<br/>

* F - Feeling preferred to Thinking: ESFJs tend to value personal considerations above objective criteria. When making decisions, they often give more weight to social implications than to logic.[8]
<br/>
<br/>

* J - Judgment preferred to Perception: ESFJs tend to plan their activities and make decisions early. They derive a sense of control through predictability. [9]

Characteristics of ESFJs


<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs focus on the outside world and assess their experiences subjectively. They
largely base their judgments on their belief system and on the effects of
actions on people. ESFJs are literal and concrete, trusting the specific,
factual information gathered through their physiological senses.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs project warmth through a genuine interest in the well-being of
others. They are often skilled at bringing out the best in people, and they want
to understand other points of view. They are serious about their
responsibilities, seeing what needs to be done and then doing it. Generally
proficient at detailed tasks, they enjoy doing little things that make life
easier for others. They value tradition and the security it offers.

<br/>
<br/>

Easily hurt, ESFJs seek approval. They take pleasure in other people's
happiness. They give generously but expect appreciation in return. Sensitive to
the physical needs of others, they respond by offering practical care. As expert
people readers, ESFJs often adapt their manner to meet the expectations of
others. However, they may have difficulty recognizing the shortcomings of loved
ones.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs tend to be vocal in expressing their sense of right and wrong. Their value
system derives from the external standards defined by their community, as
opposed to a personal set of ethics. (This is one of the traits that
distinguishes them from their ENFJ counterparts.) ESFJs raised in an environment
of high ethical standards tend to display true generosity and kindness. However,
those who grow up surrounded by a skewed set of values may develop a false sense
of integrity and use their people skills to selfishly manipulate
others-particularly if their intuition is poorly developed, leaving them unable
to foresee the consequences of their actions.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFJs seek structured, controlled environments, and tend to be good at creating
a sense of order. They generally feel insecure in an atmosphere of
uncertainty. They value the rule of law and expect the same of others. ESFJs may
be less interested in understanding the concepts behind the rules, tending to
shy away from the abstract and impersonal.[12]

<br/>
<br/>

Correlation with Enneatype

<br/>
<br/>

According to Baron and Wagele, the most common Enneatypes for ESFJs are Helpers
and Skeptics.[13]

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functions (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) form a
hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's so-called default pattern of
behavior.

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information gathering
function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making function
(thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less developed
than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding out the
person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's Achilles'
heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the Tertiary,
the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[14]

<br/>
<br/>

Jung and Myers considered the attitude of the Auxiliary, Tertiary, and Inferior
functions to be the opposite of the Dominant. In this interpretation, if the
Dominant function is extraverted, then the other three are introverted, and vice
versa. However, many modern practitioners hold that the attitude of the Tertiary
function is the same as the Dominant.[5] Using the more modern interpretation,
the cognitive functions of the ESFJ are as follows:[14]
