<h3>ESTJ</h3>

<br/>
<br/>

Every right-minded man has a philosophy of life, whether he knows it or not. Hidden away in his mind are certain governing principles, whether he formulates them in words or not, which govern his life. Surely his ideal ought to be to contribute all that he can, however little it may be, whether of money or service, to human progress.
--John D. Rockefeller, Random Reminiscences of Men and Events 

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs thrive on order and continuity. Being extraverted, their focus involves
organization of people, which translates into supervision. While ENTJs enjoy
organizing and mobilizing people according to their own theories and tactically
based agendas, ESTJs are content to enforce "the rules," often dictated by
tradition or handed down from a higher authority.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs are joiners. They seek out like-minded companions in clubs, civic groups,
churches and other service organizations. The need for belonging is woven into
the fiber of SJs. The family likewise is a central focus for ESTJs, and
attendance at such events as weddings, funerals and family reunions is
obligatory.

<br/>
<br/>

Tradition is important to the ESTJ. Holidays, birthdays and other annual
celebrations are remembered and observed often religiously by this type. The
ESTJ is inclined to seek out his roots, to trace the family heritage back to
honored ancestors both for a sense of family respectability and for a sense of
security and belonging.

<br/>
<br/>

Service, the tangible expression of responsibility, is another key focus for
ESTJs. They love to provide and to receive good service. The ESTJ merchant who
provides dependable service has done much to enhance her self image.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs have an acute sense for orthodoxy. Much of their evaluation of persons and
activities reflects their strong sense of what is "normal" and what isn't. ESTJ
humor is frequently centered around something or someone being off center or
behaving abnormally.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs promote the work ethic. Power, position and prestige should be worked for
and earned. Laziness is rarely viewed with ambivalence nor benevolence by this
type.

<br/>
<br/>

Some men can make decisions and some cannot. Some men fret and delay under criticism. I used to have a saying1 that applies here, and I note that some people have picked it up.
--Harry S. Truman, Mr. Citizen
<br/>
<br/>

"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen." 

<br/>
<br/>

The ESTJ is outspoken, a person of principles, which are readily expressed. The
ESTJ is not afraid to stand up for what she believes is right even in the face
of overwhelming odds. ESTJs are able to make the tough calls.

<br/>
<br/>

Occupations attracting ESTJs include teaching, coaching, banking, political
office, and management at all levels.  

<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis: 

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs are very good at making impersonal decisions quickly, and standing by
those decisions. They live in their Extraverted Thinking functioning, thus,
their prime directive is in discovering that which is true and logical in the
events of the real world. Circumstances calling for product invite the ESTJ to
supervise or direct other individuals toward production and
productivity. Extraverts are attracted to the "object," the external things and
people in observable reality. This bent translates into a natural interest in
goods and material objects.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Sensing 

<br/>
<br/>

The secondary Introverted Sensing is like that of the ISTJ, but not as
strong. Si provides practical form and concept data to the Te head, however,
form is not the overriding principle, especially if Thinking has already
decided. In times of need, ESTJs are tempted to overlook even necessary
information if its absence impedes closure. Secondary sensing sometimes
translates into interest in sports. The persistence of primary Thinking gives
many ESTJs a desire for discipline and regimen which can be beneficial in skills
development in the arena. 

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted iNtuition 

<br/>
<br/>

As the ESTJ matures, and as situations arise which call for suspension of
criticism, Extraverted iNtuition is allowed to play. Under the leadership of the
Te function, iNtuition gravitates toward the discovery of broad categories which
at worst amount to stereotypes. Those ESTJs who hone their Ne abilities may find
success in academia. (I've encountered ESTJs whose Ne overshadows the auxiliary
Si function--for whatever reason--to the extent that there is an appearance of
NT radical geekism.)

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling 

<br/>
<br/>

This function may rarely be expressed. ESTJs who have cultivated, or have been
blessed with, a "natural indirect expression of good will by inference," have
great prospects of developing genuine friendships (as opposed to ESTJs who
merely act out the behavior of Extraverted Feeling). Such a weak, introverted
function is best observed in facial expression, eye contact, body language, and
verbally only by implication.

The Guardian

<br/>
<br/>

As an ESTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal
with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you
take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs live in a world of facts and concrete needs. They live in the present,
with their eye constantly scanning their personal environment to make sure that
everything is running smoothly and systematically. They honor traditions and
laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs. They expect the same of
others, and have no patience or understanding of individuals who do not value
these systems. They value competence and efficiency, and like to see quick
results for their efforts.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs are take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that
things should be, that they naturally step into leadership roles. They are
self-confident and aggressive. They are extremely talented at devising systems
and plans for action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to
complete a specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical,
because they have such strongly held beliefs, and are likely to express
themselves without reserve if they feel someone isn't meeting their
standards. But at least their expressions can be taken at face-value, because
the ESTJ is extremely straight-forward and honest.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community. He or she
takes their commitments seriously, and follows their own standards of "good
citizenship" to the letter. ESTJ enjoys interacting with people, and likes to
have fun. ESTJs can be very boisterous and fun at social events, especially
activities which are focused on the family, community, or work.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become
overly detail-oriented. Since they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs,
it's important that they remember to value other people's input and opinions. If
they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling other's
needs for intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's feelings by applying logic
and reason to situations which demand more emotional sensitivity.

<br/>
<br/>

When bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from others. They feel
as if they are misunderstood and undervalued, and that their efforts are taken
for granted. Although normally the ESTJ is very verbal and doesn't have any
problem expressing themself, when under stress they have a hard time putting
their feelings into words and communicating them to others.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do
all that they can to enhance and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn,
vote, join the PTA, attend home owners association meetings, and generally do
anything that they can to promote personal and social security.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESTJ puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will
do everything that they think should be done in their job, marriage, and
community with a good amount of energy. He or she is conscientious, practical,
realistic, and dependable. While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that is
important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally
see or value the importance of goals which are outside of their practical
scope. However, if the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such goals to
practical concerns, you can bet that they'll put every effort into understanding
them and incorporating them into their quest for clarity and security.

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Extraverted Thinking
<br/>
Auxiliary: Introverted Sensing
<br/>
Tertiary: Extraverted Intuition
<br/>
Inferior: Introverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESTJ

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ESTJs as Supervisors, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Guardian. ESTJs account for about 8-12% of the
population.

<br/>
<br/>

* E - Extraversion preferred to introversion: ESTJs often feel motivated by
  their interaction with people. They tend to enjoy a wide circle of
  acquaintances, and they gain energy in social situations (whereas introverts
  expend energy).[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ESTJs tend to be more concrete than
  abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than the big
  picture, and on immediate realities rather than future possibilities.[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* T - Thinking preferred to feeling: ESTJs tend to value objective criteria
  above personal preference. When making decisions, they generally give more
  weight to logic than to social considerations.[8]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* J - Judgment preferred to perception: ESTJs tend to plan their activities and
  make decisions early. They derive a sense of control through
  predictability.[9]

Myers-Briggs description

<br/>
<br/>

ESTJs are practical, realistic, and matter-of-fact, with a natural head for
business or mechanics. Though they are not interested in subjects they see no
use for, they can apply themselves when necessary. They like to organize and run
activities. ESTJs make good administrators, especially if they remember to
consider others' feelings and points of view, which they often miss.

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Keirsey, ESTJs are civic-minded individuals who dedicate themselves
to maintaining the institutions behind a smooth-running society. They are
defenders of the status quo and strong believers in rules and procedures. ESTJs
are outgoing and do not hesitate to communicate their opinions and expectations
to others.

<br/>
<br/>

Interaction Style

<br/>
<br/>

According to Linda V. Berens' Interaction Styles model, ESTJs fall into the "In
Charge" style, being both "extraverted" (E) and "Directing" (ST). They are
outgoing, yet task-oriented, which also explains the behavior described above.

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functions (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) form a
hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's so-called default pattern of
behavior.

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information gathering
function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making function
(thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less developed
than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding out the
person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's Achilles'
heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the Tertiary,
the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[12]

<br/>
<br/>

Jung and Myers considered the attitude of the Auxiliary, Tertiary, and Inferior
functions to be the opposite of the Dominant. In this interpretation, if the
Dominant function is extraverted, then the other three are introverted, and vice
versa. However, many modern practitioners hold that the attitude of the Tertiary
function is the same as the Dominant.[5] Using the more modern interpretation,
the cognitive functions of the ESTJ are as follows:[12]

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Extraverted thinking (Te)

<br/>
<br/>

Te organizes and schedules ideas and the environment to ensure the efficient,
productive pursuit of objectives. Te seeks logical explanations for actions,
events, and conclusions, looking for faulty reasoning and lapses in
sequence. [13] The dominant Te means ESTJs use logical fact-based judgments in
the outer world of people and actions. This again explains their behavior and
leadership qualities.

<br/>
<br/>

Auxiliary: Introverted sensing (Si)

<br/>
<br/>

Si collects data in the present moment and compares it with past experiences, a
process that sometimes evokes the feelings associated with memory, as if the
subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect what is familiar, Si draws upon
history to form goals and expectations about what will happen in the
future. [14] The auxiliary Si's connection with memory and familiarity leads
ESTJs to defend the status quo and procedures.

<br/>
<br/>

Tertiary: Extraverted intuition (Ne)

<br/>
<br/>

Ne finds and interprets hidden meanings, using "what if" questions to
explore alternatives, allowing multiple possibilities to coexist. This
imaginative play weaves together insights and experiences from various sources
to form a new whole, which can then become a catalyst to action.[15] Ne's use of
abstract perception in the outer world gives ESTJs the ability to
conceptualize. However, Ne is subservient to the inward, concrete focus of Si.

<br/>
<br/>

Inferior: Introverted feeling (Fi)

<br/>
<br/>

Fi filters information based on interpretations of worth, forming judgments
according to criteria that are often intangible. Fi constantly balances an
internal set of values such as harmony and authenticity. Attuned to subtle
distinctions, Fi innately senses what is true and what is false in a
situation.[16] With Fi in the inferior position, some ESTJs may not make full
use of Fi's associations with kinship, personal connections, and congruency of
values or beliefs.
