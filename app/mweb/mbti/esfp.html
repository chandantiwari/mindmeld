<h3>ESFP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/esfp.html

<br/>
<br/>

"Where's the party?" ESFPs love people, excitement, telling stories and having
fun. The spontaneous, impulsive nature of this type is almost always
entertaining. And ESFPs love to entertain -- on stage, at work, and/or at
home. Social gatherings are an energy boost to these "people" people.

<br/>
<br/>

SPs sometimes think and talk in more of a spider-web approach. Several of my
ESFP friends jump from thought to thought in mid-sentence, touching here or
there in a manner that's almost incoherent to the listener, but will eventually
cover the waterfront by skipping on impulse from one piece of information to
another. It's really quite fascinating.

<br/>
<br/>

New! ESFPs are attracted to new ideas, new fashions, new gadgets, new
______. Perhaps it's the newness of life that attracts ESFPs to elementary
education, especially to preschool and kindergarten.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs love to talk to people about people. Some of the most colorful
storytellers are ESFPs. Their down-to-earth, often homespun wit reflects a
mischievous benevolence.

<br/>
<br/>

Almost every ESFP loves to talk. Some can be identified by the twenty minute
conversation required to ask or answer a simple factual question.

<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis:

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

The dominant function of ESFPs is concerned with the reality that is perceived
through the senses. This type's prime directive is to examine the tangible
through taste, touch, sight, feeling and hearing. ESFPs' need for new
experiences surely results from this function. Feeling gives focus to the
collected information, producing the amiable nature of this type. As perceivers,
ESFPs do not linger on moral concerns unless it is in service of a Greater Good
and/or a unifying cause.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

Feeling, which tends to decision-making in the interest of individual beings, is
auxiliary to sensing. As with all introverted functions, feeling for ESFPs has a
surreal, cryptic, quintessential nature. It is more often implied than verbally
expressed, more apparent in countenance and deed rather than word or
creed. Feeling takes care that playful pokes and pranks do no harm to the
victim.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

This tertiary function is at the ready to give definitive answers when the world
requires them. It provides a measure of balance to Introverted Feeling, allowing
the ESFP some level of boundary and protection from those who would take
advantage. When overused or overestimated, however, Thinking becomes a
liability. ESFPs do well to seek out confirmation of the soundness of
tough-minded decisions.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition
<br/>
<br/>


This function is least visible. As is the nature of the inferior (fourth)
function, ESFP intuition lacks a sense of balance. This type seems most
successful in deducing patterns and seeing connections only after a thorough
examination of the facts (which process appears quite unorganized and haphazard
to non-SPs). Although some ESFPs may develop such abilities, the mastery of
logic, analysis and abstraction is usually difficult and wearying, and not very
much fun.

The Performer

<br/>
<br/>

As an ESFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take
things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary
mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel about
them, or how they fit with your personal value system.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs live in the world of people possibilties. They love people and new
experiences. They are lively and fun, and enjoy being the center of
attention. They live in the here-and-now, and relish excitement and drama in
their lives.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs have very strong inter-personal skills, and may find themselves in the
role of the peacemaker frequently. Since they make decisions by using their
personal values, they are usually very sympathetic and concerned for other
people's well-being. They're usually quite generous and warm. They are very
observant about other people, and seem to sense what is wrong with someone
before others might, responding warmly with a solution to a practical need. They
might not be the best advice-givers in the world, because they dislike theory
and future-planning, but they are great for giving practical care.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFP is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual. They love to have
fun. If the ESFP has not developed their Thinking side by giving consideration
to rational thought processing, they tend to become over-indulgent, and place
more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their duties
and obligations. They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences of their
actions.

<br/>
<br/>

For the ESFP, the entire world is a stage. They love to be the center of
attention and perform for people. They're constantly putting on a show for
others to entertain them and make them happy. They enjoy stimulating other
people's senses, and are extremely good at it. They would love nothing more than
for life to be a continual party, in which they play the role of the fun-loving
host.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs love people, and everybody loves an ESFP. One of their greatest gifts is
their general acceptance of everyone. They are upbeat and enthusiastic, and
genuinely like almost everybody. An ESFP is unfailingly warm and generous with
their friends, and they generally treat everyone as a friend. However, once
crosesed, an ESFP is likely to make a very strong and stubborn judgment against
the person who crossed them. They are capable of deep dislike in such a
situation.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESFP under a great deal of stress gets overwhelmed with negatives thoughts
and possibilities. As an optimistic individual who lives in the world of
possibilities, negative possibilities do not sit well with them. In an effort to
combat these thoughts, they're likely to come up with simple, global statements
to explain away the problem. These simplistic explanations may or may not truly
get to the nature of the issue, but they serve the ESFP well by allowing them to
get over it.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs are likely to be very practical, although they hate structure and
routine. They like to "go with the flow", trusting in their ability to improvise
in any situation presented to them. They learn best with "hands-on" experience,
rather than by studying a book. They're uncomfortable with theory. If an ESFP
hasn't developed their intuitive side, they may tend to avoid situations which
involve a lot of theoretical thinking, or which are complex and ambiguous. For
this reason, an ESFP may have difficulty in school. On the other hand, the ESFP
does extremely well in situations where they're allowed to learn by interacting
with others, or in which they "learn by doing".

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs have a very well-developed appreciation for aesthetic beauty, and an
excellent sense of space and function. If they have the means, they're likely to
have to have many beautiful possessions, and an artfully furnished home. In
general, they take great pleasure in objects of aesthetic beauty. They're likely
to have a strong appreciation for the finer things in life, such as good food
and good wine.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESFP is a great team player. He or she is not likely to create any problems
or fuss, and is likely to create the most fun environment possible for getting
the task done. ESFPs will do best in careers in which they are able to use their
excellent people skills, along with their abilities to meld ideas into
structured formats. Since they are fast-paced individuals who like new
experiences, they should choose careers which offer or require a lot of
diversity, as well as people skills.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs usually like to feel strongly bonded with other people, and have a
connection with animals and small children that is not found in most other
types. They're likely to have a strong appreciation for the beauties of nature
as well.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESFP has a tremendous love for life, and knows how to have fun. They like to
bring others along on their fun-rides, and are typically a lot of fun to be
with. They're flexible, adaptable, genuinely interested in people, and usually
kind-hearted. They have a special ability to get a lot of fun out of life, but
they need to watch out for the pitfalls associated with living entirely in the
moment.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESFP

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ESFPs as Performers, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Artisan. ESFPs account for about 4-10% of the
population.[2][3]

<br/>
<br/>

* E - Extraversion preferred to introversion: ESFPs often feel motivated by
  their interaction with people. They tend to enjoy a wide circle of
  acquaintances, and they gain energy in social situations (whereas introverts
  expend energy).[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ESFPs tend to be more concrete than
  abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than the big
  picture, and on immediate realities rather than future possibilities .[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* F - Feeling preferred to thinking: ESFPs tend to value personal considerations
  above objective criteria. When making decisions, they often give more weight
  to social implications than to logic.[8]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* P - Perception preferred to judgment: ESFPs tend to withhold judgment and
  delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should
  circumstances change.[9]

Type description
<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs live in the moment, experiencing life to the fullest. They enjoy people,
as well as material comforts. Rarely allowing conventions to interfere with
their lives, they find creative ways to meet human needs. ESFPs are excellent
team players, focused on completing the task at hand with maximum fun and
minimum discord. Active types, they find pleasure in new experiences.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs take a hands-on approach in most things. Because they learn more by doing
than by studying or reading, they tend to rush into things, learning by
interacting with their environment. They usually dislike theory and written
explanations. Traditional schools can be difficult for ESFPs, although they tend
to do well when the subject of study interests them, or when they see the
relevance of a subject and are allowed to interact with people.

<br/>
<br/>

Observant, practical, realistic, and specific, ESFPs make decisions according to
their own personal standards. They use their Feeling judgment internally to
identify and empathize with others. Naturally attentive to the world around
them, ESFPs are keen observers of human behavior. They quickly sense what is
happening with other people and immediately respond to their individual
needs. They are especially good at mobilizing people to deal with
crises. Generous, optimistic, and persuasive, they are good at interpersonal
interactions. They often play the role of peacemaker due to their warm,
sympathetic, and tactful nature.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs love being around people and having new experiences. Living in the
here-and-now, they often do not think about long term effects or the
consequences of their actions. While very practical, they generally despise
routines, instead desiring to 'go with the flow.' They are, in fact, very play
minded. Because ESFPs learn better through hands-on experience, classroom
learning may be troublesome for many of them, especially those with a very
underdeveloped intuitive side.[4] [edit] How Others May Perceive ESFPs

<br/>
<br/>

Others usually see ESFPs as resourceful and supportive, as well as gregarious, playful, and spontaneous. ESFPs get a lot of satisfaction out of life and are fun to be around. Their exuberance and enthusiasm draw others to them. They are flexible, adaptable, congenial, and easygoing. They seldom plan ahead, trusting their ability to respond in the moment and deal effectively with whatever presents itself. They dislike structure and routine and will generally find ways to bend the rules.[4]

<br/>
<br/>

Potential Areas for Growth

<br/>
<br/>

Sometimes life circumstances do not support ESFPs in the development and
expression of the Feeling and Sensing preferences. If they have not developed
their Feeling preference, ESFPs may get caught up in the interactions of the
moment, with no mechanism for weighing, evaluating, or anchoring themselves. If
they have not developed their Sensing preference, they may focus on the sensory
data available in the moment. Their decisions may then be limited to
gratification of sensual desires, particularly those involving interactions with
other people.

<br/>
<br/>

If ESFPs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated
for their contributions, they usually feel frustrated and may become distracted
or overly impulsive. They may have trouble accepting and meeting deadlines. They
may also become hypersensitive, internalizing others’ actions and decisions.

<br/>
<br/>

It is natural for ESFPs to give less attention to their non-preferred Intuitive
and Thinking parts. If they neglect these too much, they may fail to look at
long-term consequences, acting on immediate needs of themselves and others. They
may also avoid complex or ambiguous situations and people, putting enjoyment
ahead of obligations.

<br/>
<br/>

Under great stress, ESFPs may feel overwhelmed internally by negative
possibilities. They then put energy into developing simplistic global
explanations for their negativity.[4]

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functions (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) form a
hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's so-called default pattern of
behavior.

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information gathering
function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making function
(thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less developed
than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding out the
person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's Achilles'
heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the Tertiary,
the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[12]

<br/>
<br/>

Type and personal growth

<br/>
<br/>

Each person is unique; there is no "right" or "wrong" type. The purpose of learning about personality type is to understand oneself better and enhance relationships with others. Results on the MBTI suggest the probable type based on the choices made when answering the questions; however, only the individual can determine his or her true type preference. Moreover, type does not explain everything. Human personality is much more complex.[4]

Correlation with Enneatype

<br/>
<br/>

According to Baron and Wagele, the most common Enneatypes for ESFPs are Helpers
and Enthusiasts.
