<h3>INTJ</h3>

http://typelogic.com/intj.html

<br/>
<br/>

To outsiders, INTJs may appear to project an aura of "definiteness", of
self-confidence. This self-confidence, sometimes mistaken for simple arrogance
by the less decisive, is actually of a very specific rather than a general
nature; its source lies in the specialized knowledge systems that most INTJs
start building at an early age. When it comes to their own areas of expertise --
and INTJs can have several -- they will be able to tell you almost immediately
whether or not they can help you, and if so, how. INTJs know what they know, and
perhaps still more importantly, they know what they don't know.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are perfectionists, with a seemingly endless capacity for improving upon
anything that takes their interest. What prevents them from becoming chronically
bogged down in this pursuit of perfection is the pragmatism so characteristic of
the type: INTJs apply (often ruthlessly) the criterion "Does it work?" to
everything from their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms. This
in turn produces an unusual independence of mind, freeing the INTJ from the
constraints of authority, convention, or sentiment for its own sake.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are known as the "Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in part because
they possess the unusual trait combination of imagination and
reliability. Whatever system an INTJ happens to be working on is for them the
equivalent of a moral cause to an INFJ; both perfectionism and disregard for
authority may come into play, as INTJs can be unsparing of both themselves and
the others on the project. Anyone considered to be "slacking," including
superiors, will lose their respect -- and will generally be made aware of this;
INTJs have also been known to take it upon themselves to implement critical
decisions without consulting their supervisors or co-workers. On the other hand,
they do tend to be scrupulous and even-handed about recognizing the individual
contributions that have gone into a project, and have a gift for seizing
opportunities which others might not even notice.

<br/>
<br/>

In the broadest terms, what INTJs "do" tends to be what they "know". Typical
INTJ career choices are in the sciences and engineering, but they can be found
wherever a combination of intellect and incisiveness are required (e.g., law,
some areas of academia). INTJs can rise to management positions when they are
willing to invest time in marketing their abilities as well as enhancing them,
and (whether for the sake of ambition or the desire for privacy) many also find
it useful to learn to simulate some degree of surface conformism in order to
mask their inherent unconventionality.

<br/>
<br/>

Personal relationships, particularly romantic ones, can be the INTJ's Achilles
heel. While they are capable of caring deeply for others (usually a select few),
and are willing to spend a great deal of time and effort on a relationship, the
knowledge and self-confidence that make them so successful in other areas can
suddenly abandon or mislead them in interpersonal situations.

<br/>
<br/>

This happens in part because many INTJs do not readily grasp the social rituals;
for instance, they tend to have little patience and less understanding of such
things as small talk and flirtation (which most types consider half the fun of a
relationship). To complicate matters, INTJs are usually extremely private
people, and can often be naturally impassive as well, which makes them easy to
misread and misunderstand. Perhaps the most fundamental problem, however, is
that INTJs really want people to make sense. :-) This sometimes results in a
peculiar naivete', paralleling that of many Fs -- only instead of expecting
inexhaustible affection and empathy from a romantic relationship, the INTJ will
expect inexhaustible reasonability and directness.

<br/>
<br/>

Probably the strongest INTJ assets in the interpersonal area are their intuitive
abilities and their willingness to "work at" a relationship. Although as Ts they
do not always have the kind of natural empathy that many Fs do, the Intuitive
function can often act as a good substitute by synthesizing the probable
meanings behind such things as tone of voice, turn of phrase, and facial
expression. This ability can then be honed and directed by consistent, repeated
efforts to understand and support those they care about, and those relationships
which ultimately do become established with an INTJ tend to be characterized by
their robustness, stability, and good communications.

Functional Analysis

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are idea people. Anything is possible; everything is negotiable. Whatever
the outer circumstances, INTJs are ever perceiving inner pattern-forms and using
real-world materials to operationalize them. Others may see what is and wonder
why; INTJs see what might be and say "Why not?!" Paradoxes, antinomies, and
other contradictory phenomena aptly express these intuitors' amusement at those
whom they feel may be taking a particular view of reality too seriously. INTJs
enjoy developing unique solutions to complex problems.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

Thinking in this auxiliary role is a workhorse. Closure is the payoff for
efforts expended. Evaluation begs diagnosis; product drives process. As they
come to light, Thinking tends, protects, affirms and directs iNtuition's
offspring, fully equipping them for fulfilling and useful lives. A faithful
pedagogue, Thinking argues not so much on its own behalf, but in defense of its
charges. And through this process these impressionable ideas take on the
likeness of their master.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

Feeling has a modest inner room, two doors down from the Most Imminent
iNtuition. It doesn't get out much, but lends its influence on behalf of causes
which are Good and Worthy and Humane. We may catch a glimpse of it in the
unspoken attitude of good will, or the gracious smile or nod. Some question the
existence of Feeling in this type, yet its unseen balance to Thinking is a
cardinal dimension in the full measure of the INTJ's soul.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

Sensing serves with a good will, or not at all. As other inferior functions, it
has only a rudimentary awareness of context, amount or degree. Thus INTJs sweat
the details or, at times, omit them. "I've made up my mind, don't confuse me
with the facts" could well have been said by an INTJ on a mission. Sensing's
extraverted attitude is evident in this type's bent to savor sensations rather
than to merely categorize them. Indiscretions of indulgence are likely an
expression of the unconscious vengeance of the inferior.

<br/>

Dealing with Stress

<br/>
<br/>

Since Rationals search for knowledge, competence, and eternal truths,
when these needs are blocked, they become stressed. When Rationals
experience great stress, they experience thoughts that tell them
either that they must act or think in a particular way or that they
must not act or think in a particular way. The outside observer sees
the Rational as driven by compulsions or prohibitions.

<br/>
<br/>

The Mastermind sees situations from their own unique perspective and
they enjoy finding new solutions to complex problems. They are driven
to implement their ideas whether or not others can see their vision
for improvement. If they are given no support, they dig in their heels
and work all the harder to achieve their vision. Stress comes when
they are forced to deal with too many unexpected events or if they are
forced to be too extraverted for too long. The stress manifests itself
by obsessive thoughts on external data and feelings of the world being
against them. They can recover if they are given time to be alone, get
their tasks rebalanced and have time to pursue their visionary
solutions. It's best if others do not try to give them advice or
suggestions. Says Vince, "I can see ways to make information more
accurate with less effort which will greatly benefit the
organization. Unfortunately, most people can't see what I see until I
actually can give them a working model. Luckily my current boss has
faith in my visions and gives me some free reign. He doesn't ask me to
account for all of my time and gives me a heads-up when a specific
deadline is coming up. This is so much better than my last boss who
pressured me all of the time that I became less effective and wanted
to withdraw from everyone."

The Scientist

<br/>
<br/>

As an INTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take
things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where
you deal with things rationally and logically.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs live in the world of ideas and strategic planning. They value
intelligence, knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in
these regards, which they continuously strive to fulfill. To a somewhat lesser
extent, they have similar expectations of others.

<br/>
<br/>

With Introverted Intuition dominating their personality, INTJs focus their
energy on observing the world, and generating ideas and possibilities. Their
mind constantly gathers information and makes associations about it. They are
tremendously insightful and usually are very quick to understand new
ideas. However, their primary interest is not understanding a concept, but
rather applying that concept in a useful way. Unlike the INTP, they do not
follow an idea as far as they possibly can, seeking only to understand it
fully. INTJs are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for
closure and organization usually requires that they take some action.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJ's tremendous value and need for systems and organization, combined with
their natural insightfulness, makes them excellent scientists. An INTJ scientist
gives a gift to society by putting their ideas into a useful form for others to
follow. It is not easy for the INTJ to express their internal images, insights,
and abstractions. The internal form of the INTJ's thoughts and concepts is
highly individualized, and is not readily translatable into a form that others
will understand. However, the INTJ is driven to translate their ideas into a
plan or system that is usually readily explainable, rather than to do a direct
translation of their thoughts. They usually don't see the value of a direct
transaction, and will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are
non-linear. However, their extreme respect of knowledge and intelligence will
motivate them to explain themselves to another person who they feel is deserving
of the effort.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the
background until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in
leadership roles, they are quite effective, because they are able to objectively
see the reality of a situation, and are adaptable enough to change things which
aren't working well. They are the supreme strategists - always scanning
available ideas and concepts and weighing them against their current strategy,
to plan for every conceivable contingency.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs spend a lot of time inside their own minds, and may have little interest
in the other people's thoughts or feelings. Unless their Feeling side is
developed, they may have problems giving other people the level of intimacy that
is needed. Unless their Sensing side is developed, they may have a tendency to
ignore details which are necessary for implementing their ideas.

<br/>
<br/>

The INTJ's interest in dealing with the world is to make decisions, express
judgments, and put everything that they encounter into an understandable and
rational system. Consequently, they are quick to express judgments. Often they
have very evolved intuitions, and are convinced that they are right about
things. Unless they complement their intuitive understanding with a
well-developed ability to express their insights, they may find themselves
frequently misunderstood. In these cases, INTJs tend to blame misunderstandings
on the limitations of the other party, rather than on their own difficulty in
expressing themselves. This tendency may cause the INTJ to dismiss others input
too quickly, and to become generally arrogant and elitist.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are ambitious, self-confident, deliberate, long-range thinkers. Many INTJs
end up in engineering or scientific pursuits, although some find enough
challenge within the business world in areas which involve organizing and
strategic planning. They dislike messiness and inefficiency, and anything that
is muddled or unclear. They value clarity and efficiency, and will put enormous
amounts of energy and time into consolidating their insights into structured
patterns.

<br/>
<br/>

Other people may have a difficult time understanding an INTJ. They may see them
as aloof and reserved. Indeed, the INTJ is not overly demonstrative of their
affections, and is likely to not give as much praise or positive support as
others may need or desire. That doesn't mean that he or she doesn't truly have
affection or regard for others, they simply do not typically feel the need to
express it. Others may falsely perceive the INTJ as being rigid and set in their
ways. Nothing could be further from the truth, because the INTJ is committed to
always finding the objective best strategy to implement their ideas. The INTJ is
usually quite open to hearing an alternative way of doing something.

<br/>
<br/>

When under a great deal of stress, the INTJ may become obsessed with mindless
repetitive, Sensate activities, such as over-drinking. They may also tend to
become absorbed with minutia and details that they would not normally consider
important to their overall goal.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs need to remember to express themselves sufficiently, so as to avoid
difficulties with people misunderstandings. In the absence of properly
developing their communication abilities, they may become abrupt and short with
people, and isolationists.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs have a tremendous amount of ability to accomplish great things. They have
insight into the Big Picture, and are driven to synthesize their concepts into
solid plans of action. Their reasoning skills gives them the means to accomplish
that. INTJs are most always highly competent people, and will not have a problem
meeting their career or education goals. They have the capability to make great
strides in these arenas. On a personal level, the INTJ who practices tolerances
and puts effort into effectively communicating their insights to others has
everything in his or her power to lead a rich and rewarding life.

<br/>
<br/>

What does Success mean to an INTJ?

<br/>
<br/>

People with the INTJ personality type are serious, analytical and
perfectionistic. They look at a problem or idea from multiple
perspectives and systematically analyze it with objective logic,
discarding things that turn out to be problematic, and evolving their
own understanding of something when new information turns out to be
useful. There is no other personality type who does this as naturally
as the INTJ. They are natural scientists and mathematicians. Once
given an idea, they are driven to understand it as thoroughly as
possible. They usually have very high standards for their own
understanding and accomplishments, and generally will only value and
consider other individuals who have shown that they meet or surpass
the INTJ's own understanding on a given issue. INTJs value clarity and
conciseness, and have little esteem for behaviors and attitudes that
are purely social. Social "niceties" often seem unnecessary and
perhaps even ungenuine to the INTJ, who is always seeking to improve
their substantive understanding. INTJ's highly value social
interaction that is centered around the meaningful exchange of ideas,
but they usually dismiss the importance of being friendly or likeable
in other social contexts, and they are likely to be uncomfortable with
interactions that are primarily emotional, rather than logical. INTJs
value structure, order, knowledge, competence, and logic. Above all,
they value their own ideas and intuitions about the world. An INTJ's
feeling of success depends primarily upon their own level of
understanding and accomplishment, but also depends upon the level of
structure in their life, and their ability to respect the intelligence
and competence of those who share their life.

<br/>
<br/>

Allowing Your INTJ Strengths to Flourish

<br/>
<br/>

As an INTJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and be more content with your role.

<br/>
<br/>

Nearly all INTJs will recognize the following characteristics in
themselves. They should embrace and nourish these strengths:

<br/>
<br/>

The INTJ's mind is naturally geared towards systematically analyzing information from many contextual perspectives, and rejecting or retaining information as they become aware of its usefulness or validity. They probably do very well in school, and in any pursuit that requires serious analytical thinking.
They're extremely insightful, and see things that are not obvious to others. This ability to see patterns and meanings in the world can help the INTJ in many different ways.
When given a goal or context, an INTJ is able to generate all kinds of possibilities. They're able to see the problem from many different angles, and come up with a solution that fits the needs of the current situation.
They don't take criticism personally, and are open to changing their opinions when they're shown a better idea or better way of doing something.
An INTJ has a "stick to it" attitude. They're not afraid of hard work, and will put forth a great deal of effort towards something that they are interested in. This persistence will help the INTJ to achieve any identified goal.
Usually intelligent and able to concentrate and focus, the INTJ can usually grasp difficult ideas and concepts. 

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs who have a well-developed Extraverted Thinking function to complement their dominant Introverted iNtuition will enjoy these very special gifts:

<br/>
<br/>

They can discriminate well amongst their intuitions and build ingenious systems to meet identified goals, or determine a successful plan of action to meet an identified need. In such a way, they may be brilliant scientists, doctors, mathematicians, or corporate strategists.
Their deep understanding, logical abilities, and persistence may enable them to make discoveries or uncover new ways of looking at something. In such a way, they may perform a great service to society. For example, an INTJ is the likely personality type to discover the cure for cancer.
The INTJ with well-developed judgment will be able to grasp and process concepts that are beyond what their natural intelligence appears to be able to handle.
If they have achieved a good amount of life wisdom, an INTJ can become a powerful political force. 

<br/>
<br/>

Potential Problem Areas

<br/>
<br/>

With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good". Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are rare and intelligent people with many special gifts. This should be kept in mind as you read some of the more negative material about INTJ weaknesses. Remember that these weaknesses are natural. We offer this information to enact positive change, rather than as blatant criticism. We want you to grow into your full potential, and be the happiest and most successful person that you can become.

<br/>
<br/>

Most of the weaker characteristics that are found in INTJs are due to their dominant function (Introverted iNtuition) overtaking their personality to the point that the other forces in their personality exist merely to serve the purposes of Introverted iNtuition. In such cases, an INTJ may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:

<br/>
<br/>

May be unaware (and sometimes uncaring) of how they come across to others
<br/>
May quickly dismiss input from others without really considering it
<br/>
May apply their judgment more often towards others, rather than towards themselves
<br/>
With their ability to see an issue from many sides, they may always find others at fault for problems in their own lives
<br/>
May look at external ideas and people with the primary purpose of finding fault
<br/>
May take pride in their ability to be critical and find fault in people and things
<br/>
May have unrealistic and/or unreasonable expectations of others
<br/>
May be intolerant of weaknesses in others
<br/>
May believe that they're always right
<br/>
May be cuttingly derisive and sarcastic towards others
<br/>
May have an intense and quick temper
<br/>
May hold grudges, and have difficulty forgiving people
<br/>
May be wishy-washy and unsure how to act in situations that require quick decision making
<br/>
May have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to others
<br/>
May see so many tangents everywhere that they can't stay focused on the bottom line or the big picture 

<br/>
<br/>

Explanation of Problems

<br/>
<br/>

Most of the problems described above are a result of Introverted iNtuition overtaking the INTJ's personality to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Introverted iNtuition. A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an INTJ, the dominant Introverted iNtuition needs to be well-supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Thinking function. If Extraverted Thinking exists only to support the desires of Introverted iNtuition, then neither function is being used to its potential.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and sees everything from many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with new information to consider. Introverted iNtuition is sort of like a framework for understanding that exists in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive framework. If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that person must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are constantly taking in information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively lengthy manner in order to be understood. That presents quite a challenge to the INTJ. It's not unusual for an INTJ to feel overwhelmed with all of the things that he or she needs to consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation.

<br/>
<br/>

When Introverted iNtuition dominates the INTJ such that the other functions cannot serve their own purposes, we find the INTJ cutting off information that it needs to consider. If the psyche is presented with information that looks anything like something that Introverted iNtuition has processed in the past, it uses Extraverted Thinking to quickly reject that information. The psyche uses Extraverted Thinking to reject the ideas, rather than analyzing the information within its intuitive framework, and therefore reduces the likelihood that the framework will have to be reshaped and redefined.

<br/>
<br/>

Using Extraverted Thinking in this manner serves the INTJ's psyche in two ways: 1) it saves it the energy that would have to be expended to truly consider new information, and 2) it protects the INTJ's sacred inner world. In either case, it is not ideal. It causes the INTJ to not consider information that may be useful or criticial in developing a real understanding of an issue. It also probably causes the INTJ to come off as too strongly opinionated or snobbish to others.

<br/>
<br/>

The better use of Extraverted Thinking for an INTJ would be to use it to assess the INTJ's rich insights and weigh them against the external world. When the INTJ personality uses Extraverted Thinking to cut off incoming information, rather than to judge internal intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like getting the answers to a test without having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer right away, rather than to have to figure everything out. For the INTJ, who has a tremendous amount of information and "studying" that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts. Most INTJs will do this to some extent. The real problems occur when an INTJ personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely self-important and rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas.

<br/>
<br/>

Solutions

<br/>
<br/>

To grow as an individual, the INTJ needs to focus on applying their judgment to things only after they have gone through their intuition. In other words, the INTJ needs to consciously try not to use their judgment to dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot effectively judge something that they don't understand. The INTJ needs to take things entirely into their intuition in order to understand them. It may be neccesary to give your intuition enough time to work through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of understanding. INTJs need to focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but rather to support their intuitive framework.

<br/>
<br/>

An INTJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of their judgments, and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something external to themself, or are they judging something that they have sifted through their intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an INTJ will judge something without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to judge.

<br/>
<br/>

Living Happily in our World as an INTJ

<br/>
<br/>

Some INTJs have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, with having unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, and with not putting forth effort to meet others' emotional needs. These issues stem primarily from the common INTJ habit of using Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally, rather than internally, and therefore diminish the importance of the external world, and increase the importance of the INTJ's own internal world. INTJs who recognize that their knowledge and understanding (and therefore general happiness and feeling of success) can be enriched by the synergy of other people's knowledge and understanding will find that they can be committed to their rich internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with others. In order to accomplish this, the INTJ needs to recognize the importance of extraversion, and develop their highest extraverted function, Extraverted Thinking.

<br/>
<br/>

An INTJ who uses Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally rather than internally may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations for others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others. This will preserve the sanctity of the INTJ's inner world of ideas, but will reduce a lot of valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the development of the INTJ's rich structural framework of understanding. In extreme cases, the INTJ may find himself or herself quite along and lonely.

<br/>
<br/>

More commonly, an INTJ's interpersonal problems will occur when they express their displeasure to those close to them in very biting and hurtful terms. Everyone needs emotional distance at one time or another, and the INTJ wants more than most types. Perhaps this is why INTJs are famous for their biting sarcasm. An INTJ's internal world is extremely important to them. They may be protecting their internal world by using sarcasm to keep others at an emotional distance, or they may be sarcastic with others because they believe that they have the more evolved and logical understanding of the issue at hand, and seek to cut off the spurious input that they're receiving. This is an important distinction to recognize. An INTJ who is seeking an emotional respite can find ways to be alone that don't require injuring feelings and damaging relationships. When distance is required, the INTJ should just "leave". If an explanation is necessary, an INTJ should use their Extraverted Thinking to explain their need rationally and objectively, rather than using Extraverted Thinking to insult the other person, and therefore prod them into leaving.

<br/>
<br/>

Specific suggestions:

<br/>
<br/>

Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask questions if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea. Try not to begin judging anything about the idea until you have understood it entirely.
Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person. Take in that person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with whom you're speaking.
If you become upset, walk away immediately. DO NOT express anger. When you get angry, you lose. After you have calmed down, apologize for leaving and continue with what you were doing.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life. Remember that people with the Sensing preference need to be communicated with in a direct, concise manner. Speak plainly and simply with Sensors, giving "yes" or "no" answers.
Try to be on good terms with all people, even those that you consider beneath you. Try to understand that everybody has something to offer.
When you make judgments or decisions, try to be aware of your motivation for making the judgment. Are you more interested in finding fault externally, or in improving your own understanding? Seek first to understand, and then to judge. 

<br/>
<br/>

Ten Rules to Live By to Achieve INTJ Success

<br/>
<br/>

Feed Your Strengths! Do things that allow your brilliant intuition and logical abilities to flourish. Explore the fascinating worlds of science, mathematics, law and medicine. Give your mind an outlet for its exceptional analytical abilities, and watch them grow.
<br/>
Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal ideas and intuitions, rather than as a means of disregarding other people's ideas.
<br/>
Talk Through Your Thoughts. You need to step through your intuitions in order to put them into perspective. Give yourself time to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others. You'll find externalizing your internal intuitions to be a valuable exercise. If you don't have someone to discuss your ideas with, try expressing your ideas clearly in writing.
<br/>
Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you don't respect the person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. Steven Covey says it so well when he says: "Seek first to understand, and then to be understood."
<br/>
When You Get Angry, You Lose. Your passion and intensity are strong assets, but can be very harmful if you allow yourself to fall into the "Anger Trap". Remember that Anger is destructive to your personal relationships. Work through your anger before you impress it upon others, or you will likely find yourself alone. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a non-personal and dispassionate manner.
<br/>
Respect your Need for Intellectual Compatibility Don't expect yourself to be a "touchy-feely" or "warm-fuzzy" person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with others will start with the head, rather than the heart. Be aware of other's emotional needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.
<br/>
Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.
<br/>
Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.
<br/>
Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by positive attitudes. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to INTJs as Masterminds,[4] one of the four types belonging to
the temperament he called the Rationals.

<br/>
<br/>

I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: INTJs tend to be quiet and
reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather than
a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social situations
(whereas extraverts gain energy).[8]

<br/>
<br/>

N - Intuition preferred to sensing: INTJs tend to be more abstract than
concrete. They focus their attention on the big picture rather than the details
and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities.[9]

<br/>
<br/>

T - Thinking preferred to feeling: INTJs tend to value objective criteria above
personal preference. When making decisions they generally give more weight to
logic than to social considerations.[10]

<br/>
<br/>

J - Judgment preferred to perception: INTJs tend to plan their activities and
make decisions early. They derive a sense of control through predictability,
which to perceptive types may seem limiting. [11

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs apply (often ruthlessly) the criterion "Does it work?" to everything from
their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms. This in turn produces
an unusual independence of mind, freeing the INTJ from the constraints of
authority, convention, or sentiment for its own sake ... INTJs are known as the
"Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in part because they possess the
unusual trait combination of imagination and reliability. Whatever system an
INTJ happens to be working on is for them the equivalent of a moral cause to an
INFJ; both perfectionism and disregard for authority may come into play
... Personal relationships, particularly romantic ones, can be the INTJ's
Achilles heel ... This happens in part because many INTJs do not readily grasp
the social rituals ... Perhaps the most fundamental problem, however, is that
INTJs really want people to make sense.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are analytical. Like INTPs, they are most comfortable working alone and
tend to be less sociable than other types. Nevertheless, INTJs are prepared to
lead if no one else seems up to the task, or if they see a major weakness in the
current leadership. They tend to be pragmatic, logical, and creative. They have
a low tolerance for spin or rampant emotionalism. They are not generally
susceptible to catchphrases and do not recognize authority based on tradition,
rank, or title.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs are strong individualists who seek new angles or novel ways of looking at
things. They enjoy coming to new understandings. They tend to be insightful and
mentally quick; however, this mental quickness may not always be outwardly
apparent to others since they keep a great deal to themselves. They are very
determined people who trust their vision of the possibilities, regardless of
what others think. They may even be considered the most independent of all of
the sixteen personality types. INTJs are at their best in quietly and firmly
developing their ideas, theories, and principles.

<br/>
<br/>

Hallmarks of the INTJ include independence of thought and a desire for
efficiency. They work best when given autonomy and creative freedom. They harbor
an innate desire to express themselves by conceptualizing their own intellectual
designs. They have a talent for analyzing and formulating complex
theories. INTJs are generally well-suited for occupations within academia,
research, consulting, management, science, engineering, and law. They are often
acutely aware of their own knowledge and abilities-as well as their limitations
and what they don't know (a quality that tends to distinguish them from
INTPs). INTJs thus develop a strong confidence in their ability and talents,
making them natural leaders.

<br/>
<br/>

In forming relationships, INTJs tend to seek out others with similar character
traits and ideologies. Agreement on theoretical concepts is an important aspect
of their relationships. By nature INTJs can be demanding in their expectations,
and approach relationships in a rational manner. As a result, INTJs may not
always respond to a spontaneous infatuation but wait for a mate who better fits
their set criteria. They tend to be stable, reliable, and dedicated. Harmony in
relationships and home life tends to be extremely important to them. They
generally withhold strong emotion and do not like to waste time with what they
consider irrational social rituals. This may cause non-INTJs to perceive them as
distant and reserved; nevertheless, INTJs are usually very loyal partners who
are prepared to commit substantial energy and time into a relationship to make
it work.

<br/>
<br/>

As mates, INTJs want harmony and order in the home and in relationships. The
most independent of all types,[16] INTJs trust their intuition when choosing
friends and mates-even in spite of contradictory evidence or pressure from
others. The emotions of an INTJ are hard to read, and neither male nor female
INTJs are apt to express emotional reactions. At times, INTJs seem cold,
reserved, and unresponsive, while in fact they are almost hypersensitive to
signals of rejection from those they care for. In social situations, INTJs may
also be unresponsive and may neglect small rituals designed to put others at
ease. For example, INTJs may communicate that idle dialogue such as small talk
is a waste of time. This may create the impression that the INTJ is in a
hurry-an impression that is not always intended. In their interpersonal
relationships, INTJs are usually better in a working situation than in a
recreational situation.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs direct their energy towards the inner world of thoughts and emotions. They use their imaginations to come up with new ideas, possibilities and perspectives. They often organise their lives on a logical basis, and produce plans and strategies to put their ideas into practice.
What makes an INTJ tick?
<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the perceptive one of iNtuition. Characteristics associated with this function include:

<br/>
<br/>
    - Likes looking at information from a global viewpoint, spotting patterns and relationships, that lead to an understanding of the key issues
<br/>
    - Focuses more on possibilities for the future than the here-and-now
<br/>
    - Enjoys change, challenge, and variety 
<br/>
<br/>

The perceptive iNtuition function is introverted. That is, iNtuition is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The INTJ will therefore:

<br/>
<br/>
    - Seek to develop a understanding of how the world can be
<br/>
    - Seek to understand the patterns underlying his/her observations
<br/>
    - Be strategic in nature, wanting to establish a clear vision towards which the INTJ is working
<br/>
    - Not involve others in the development of that vision 

<br/>
<br/>
The iNtuition function is primarily supported by extraverted Thinking judgement. That is, Thinking judgement is used primarily to manage the outer world of actions and words. This will modify the way that the iNtuition is directed, by:
<br/>
<br/>

    - focusing the (inner world) iNtuition on ideas and possibilities that relate to systems and concepts
<br/>
    - inwardly maintaining a long term vision. Rather than communicating this vision directly, it may tend to surface in the form of criticism of ideas and situations that do not conform.
<br/>
    - applying logical analysis to perceived patterns and possibilities, enabling the INTJ to quickly see the underlying principles in a situation 

<br/>
<br/>
The classic temperament of an INTJ is Promethean, or Phlegmatic, for whom a basic driving force is the search for competence or excellence.
Contributions to the team of an INTJ
<br/>
<br/>

In a team environment, the INTJ can contribute by:

<br/>
<br/>
    - challenging the status quo
<br/>
    - leading the team to a greater understanding of the concepts and principles involved
<br/>
    - finding ways to overcome apparently insurmountable difficulties
<br/>
    - developing and maintaining a sense of direction in the team's work
<br/>
    - observing and understanding the way the organisation works, and leading the team to take appropriate action
<br/>
    - producing work to a high level of quality
<br/>
    - ensuring that ideas and vision are translated into action 
<br/>
<br/>

The potential ways in which an INTJ can irritate others include:

<br/>
<br/>
    - being single-minded or stubborn
<br/>
    - not taking sufficient account of current realities
<br/>
    - not expressing appreciation for the contributions of others,
    particularly where it hasn't been fully competent
<br/>
    - not delegating
<br/>
    - making errors of fact, and appearing to make decisions
    irrespective of the facts

<br/>
<br/>
Personal Growth
<br/>
<br/>
As with all types, the INTJ can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as:
<br/>
<br/>

    - articulating the INTJ's vision, and allowing others to contribute to its development
<br/>
    - expressing appreciation for work done, even when it falls short of the INTJ's personal standards
<br/>
    - investigating the facts, and documenting them, before interpreting what they mean
<br/>
    - taking time to consider the impact of the INTJ's approach and ideas on people's feelings
<br/>
    - looking for and acknowledging positive contributions and areas of agreement, rather than just seeing flaws and areas of disagreement 
<br/>
<br/>

Recognising Stress

<br/>
<br/>
As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the
natural style, so the INTJ will behave more according to type when
under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the INTJ might:

<br/>
<br/>
    - retire to a private place and think through a problem until the
    INTJ has formulated a complete plan for solving it
<br/>
    - try to maintain a high degree of quality in the solution
<br/>
    - criticise others' ideas, particularly if they involve
    compromising quality
<br/>
    - make errors of fact, or pursue ideas that are unrealistic 

<br/>
<br/>
Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the INTJ's shadow may appear - a
negative form of ESFP. Example characteristics are:

<br/>
<br/>
    - doing things to excess - e.g.: eating, drinking or exercising
<br/>
    - acting very impulsively, perhaps starting off more projects than the INTJ
    could hope to accomplish
<br/>
    - expressing emotions in an intensive and uncontrolled way
<br/>
    - being very sensitive to criticism
<br/>
    - asking for lots of information that is irrelevant 
<br/>
<br/>

The shadow is part of the unconscious that is often visible to others, onto whom
the shadow is projected. The INTJ may therefore readily see these faults in
others without recognising it in him/her self.

<br/>
<br/>
http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INTJ_rel.html

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs believe in constant growth in relationships, and strive for
independence for themselves and their mates. They are constantly
embarking on "fix-up" projects to improve the overall quality of their
lives and relationships. They take their commitments seriously, but
are open to redefining their vows, if they see something which may
prove to be an improvement over the existing understanding. INTJs are
not likely to be "touchy-feely" and overly affirming with their mates
or children, and may at times be somewhat insensitive to their
emotional needs. However, INTJs are in general extremely capable and
intelligent individuals who strive to always be their best, and be
moving in a positive direction. If they apply these basic goals to
their personal relationships, they likely to enjoy happy and healthy
interaction with their families and friends.

<br/>
<br/>
http://www.knowyourtype.com/intj.html

<br/>
<br/>
INTJ is a type steeped in independence. Many of their relationships
will develop slowly due to a perceived arrogance. In the family as
well as all other fronts for the INTJ life can always be better. They
expect people and performance to get better everyday, which means they
ultimately become frustrated with others. A battle of wills within the
family is not unexpected when INTJ's are involved 

<br/>
<br/>
The same need for improvement can make for difficult friendships with
INTJ's. They are slow in developing due to their perceived arrogance
and will not tolerate stagnation. They enjoy learning through arguing
or "friendly discussions" but these scenarios are often interpreted as
obnoxious behavior. 

<br/>
<br/>

In love relationships the INTJ runs the risk of being
misunderstood. They will challenge a mate to improve and view it as
the ultimate act of love, to foster development. But INTJ's need to
also verbally communicate this intention as a positive and not be
caught in a "bully" role. 

<br/>
<br/>

Career

<br/>
<br/>

INTJ's view work as another system that can be improved. They will
become frustrated if not given the opportunity to make things
better. They often do well in Laboratory environments where systems
can be set in place to achieve maximum output, remember the maximum
can always be better. Other popular INTJ career directions include:
Management Consultant, Economist, Computer Programmer and
Mathematician. 

<br/>
<br/>
Education

<br/>
<br/>
The INTJ can have trouble in school if not properly motivated. A 
rigidly structured school can frustrate their yearning to make things
better and they can become aloof. Their intelligence is unquestioned
but their ability to stomach someone else's way can prevent them from
achieving success.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Visionaries - 'Time is of the essence.' 

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs are self-assured analytical types with a great need to innovate
to achieve their goals. They are usually very original, creative
thinkers who need to feel and appear competent.

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs' particular intellectual style comes from the interaction of
their preferences for intuition and thinking. They are usually very
gifted at seeing the big picture. They often talk about "mapping"
things out in their head and seeing how things fit together. This
makes them naturally drawn to systems-thinking or any type of thinking
which requires facility with connection, abstraction and
complexity. They are able to use these skills in the kind of careers
which often attract them - architecture, law, and management. Many
scientists and engineers have a preference for INTJ.

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs often appear to others first and foremost as thinking
types. This is because thinking in all its forms - from critiquing to
prioritising -  is what INTJs most readily do when engaged with
others. But at heart, they are primarily ideas people. It is when they
spend time reflecting that INTJs find connections, operate on hunches,
theorise and cultivate their vision. Unlike their outer life which is
usually fairly structured and controlled, an INTJ's inner life can
sometimes seem a pretty chaotic maelstrom of possibilities and ideas.   
<br/>
<br/>

Of all the types, INTJs are most motivated by "vision". They  have a
great need to come up with a unifying idea of a future, improved state
which is then their job to realise. This inner vision can be so strong
for INTJs and so individual that they are often reckoned to be the
most independent-minded of all the types. In other words, they will
sometimes cling stubbornly to what they "know" to be true and they
will refuse to listen to others. 

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs have a great need to be purposeful. They need to feel they are
continually achieving, moving towards their vision or improving their
mastery or competence in some way. Time is truly "of the essence" for
INTJs.  
<br/>
<br/>

This often means that INTJs come across to others as potentially
impatient and time-pressured. Of all the introvert types, INTJs
reguarly communicate in ways which can make them appear like
extraverts rather than introverts. For example, they tend to speak
quickly and forcefully, putting a great deal of energy into their
communications.  

<br/>
<br/>
Their true introverted nature, however, can be seen in their need for
privacy. To feel sane, INTJs must spend quality time alone. This may
mean time for solitary pursuits or it may mean time for reading and
writing. Like all NT types, they dislike social chit chat. If they are
going to expend energy conversing they usually want it to be more
puposeful than that. This means that INTJs can be difficult to really
get to know.  

<br/>
<br/>
Competence is an important issue for INTJs. They have a need to feel
they are able to do everything very well and to appear competent to
others. Many will say they will just not tackle jobs if they think
they will not be very good at them. On the other hand, they can get
bored easily and need to feel challenged.  
 
<br/>
<br/>
As TJs they find it easy to keep their focus on being organised but
like all NJ types their lack of attention to practical detail can mean
their organisation falls apart slightly at the seams. They could
misread their diary, for example, or pick up the wrong documents. 

<br/>
<br/>
However, of all the N types, INTJs can sometimes be very good on
detail if it is related in some way to the attainment of their bigger
goal or if they feel their competence may be at stake in some
way. Proof-reading documents, is a case in point. In these instances,
they will go all out to ensure there are no mistakes.  

<br/>
<br/>
The research on type preferences in the UK suggest that only 1.4% of
the population have a preference for INTJ and that it is the least
common type. It is not surprising then that most INTJs say that they
are aware of being "different" from most of the people they meet.  
<br/>
<br/>
 
Relationships, other than family and a few close personal friends,
don't usually matter greatly to INTJs yet they are often conscious of
wanting to serve people in some way. Indeed many an INTJ's vision is
ultimately designed to make life better in some way for people.  
<br/>
<br/>
 
But relationships with others can present a difficulty for INTJs. They
know they cannot achieve their vision alone and they can drive others
towards the same exacting standards of competence and commitment that
they use for themselves. This can cause resentment, particularly if
the INTJ has not learned to openly appreciate others and thank them
for their efforts. Female INTJs often learn this lesson more readily
than male INTJs.  
 
<br/>
<br/>

Ultimately it is important for INTJs to keep their intuition within
useful bounds. They must come to see that their inner vision is not
always right. It can be overly abstract and impractical and not take
adequate account of human feelings, frailties and values. They can
become more effective if they learn to use their own thinking skills
to critique their vision more and by soliciting and paying attention
to other people's views.

Common relationship Issues for INTJs

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs show caring by spending time with people discussing things of
interest to them or doing something which stimulates both parties'
interests in some way. 
 
<br/>
<br/>
INTJs like others to admire their intellectual abilities and their
insights. They also like people to respect their need for privacy and
time to reflect.  

<br/>
<br/>
http://thomaslauer.com/start/How_to_handle_an_INTJ

<br/>
<br/>
Expect debate. INTJs enjoy tearing things apart to understand them and
to prove (or disprove) their worthiness. 

<br/>
<br/>
They will gladly argue a point they don't actually support, just for
the sake of argument or to probe things. This bears repeating: an INTJ
can easily and persuasively assume a point of view which is wholly
contrary to his actual conviction. If in doubt, ask. 

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs do have a strong sense of humour, often dry and quick, but also
a bit warped. It can easily take a morbid streak. 

<br/>
<br/>
Expect blunt, honest, sometimes even hurtful answers: if you don't
want to hear the truth, you wouldn't ask, would you? 

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs like to do lists, enumerations, pattern sorting and putting
things into an ordered state (ordered for them, not necessarily for
the rest of the world). 

<br/>
<br/>
Statements you can't back up with either solid facts or solid reasoning will at best be ignored and at worst poked fun at in ways not many people would describe as nice.

<br/>
<br/>
Try to be both concise and precise. Using 81 woolly words where 18
sharp ones would suffice will not endear you to them. 

<br/>
<br/>

They do love wordplay though: if you can re-package your 81 woolly
words in a witty, unexpected, esoteric fashion, they'll appreciate
that. 

<br/>
<br/>
Don't expect an INTJ to respect anything you (or some other
authorities) say just because you (or some other authorities) say
it. INTJs bow to one authority only: rationality. 

<br/>
<br/>
For an INTJ truth is more important than simply being right, so they
will readily admit errors or mistakes (once they have been convinced
something they said or did was indeed wrong - to convince them may not
be easy though). INTJs unfortunately expect others to work likewise
(and react bewildered if they don't). 

<br/>
<br/>
Stick to a statement after being proven wrong by facts or reasoning
and an INTJ will treat you as an irrational idiot and everything you
say as probable nonsense. 

<br/>
<br/>
Try not to be repetitive. It bores them to death.

<br/>
<br/>
Clumsy attempts at political correctness and similar aberrations will
greatly amuse them. 

<br/>
<br/>
Don't be surprised at sarcasm, hyperbole and flippancy. In fact, a
non-sarcastic INTJ must be severely ill. 

<br/>
<br/>
Expect punctuality and exactness. They try hard to be on time and they
hate unpunctual-ness, especially of the casual sort: the words
obsessive-compulsive come to mind. 

<br/>
<br/>
They tend to be quite forgetful in everyday life, especially for
trivial things like car keys, dropped tools or anniversaries. 

<br/>
<br/>
You can't trust that an INTJ takes something, anything for
granted. They do take some things for granted, but you'll never know
what and what not. The more extreme ones are actually willing to put
everything to the test (and I mean everything). 

<br/>
<br/>
Remember that INTJs believe in workable solutions. They are
open-minded to all and every possibility, but they will quickly
discard any concept they deem unfeasible. 

<br/>
<br/>
Their way of showing that something you say (an idea, a suggestion)
has potential or merit is by trying to pull it apart (which shocks
those poor souls who instead expected awe or admiration). The ultimate
INTJ insult to an idea or suggestion is to ignore it altogether,
because that means it's not even interesting enough to deconstruct. 

<br/>
<br/>
INTJs can and will make themselves and everything else (and again, I
mean everything) the butt of their jokes, witticisms and deeply
nonsensical remarks. 

<br/>
<br/>

Do not expect INTJs to care very much about how you view them. They
already know that many people see them as arrogant bastards with a
weird sense of humour and they long since got used to it.

Everything Has Room for Improvement

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs have an inner world rich with endless possibilities that, when
combined with their Thinking-Judging preferences, gives them a drive
toward constant improvement of everything. Indeed, these are the
"better idea" people of the typological world. Everything -- words,
plans, designs, ideas, even people -- has room for improvement. In the
INTJ's eyes, even the best can be made better.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs have a natural propensity for organization, and as such they
often rise to the top of any system in which they find
themselves. They tend to be "big picture" people (iNtuitive) who can
see the forest as well as the intricacies of its component parts. (To
an INTJ, there's more to a forest than merely trees.) With their
capacity for follow-through (Judging), they have a high completion
rate in their many undertakings. People naturally look to them for a
job well done, a work aptly spoken, an opportunity seized. And they
usually rise to such occasions with aplomb.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs are among the most independent of the sixteen types. Their theme
songs may be "My Way." As with other NTs, this independence often
gives them an aura of arrogance that makes in-depth relationships
develop slowly. At both work and play they can often seem aloof and
sometimes argumentative. For INTJs, such behavior is simply the result
of their attempt to stimulate the world around them. They can be
stunned, even appear hurt, when others accuse them of being distant
and seemingly uncaring, but it is, ironically, the INTJs' caring that
has been the source of the provocation. They may even seem surprised
at others' taking offense when their motivation was fostering
improvement. Again, as with other NTs, INTJs learn by arguing, part of
their continuing quest to understand the universe. The problem is that
an INTJ's "friendly discussion" may be seen by others as hostile, even
obnoxious behavior.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Statistically, there are more male INTJs than female. Not
surprisingly, the INTJ female's independence, intellectual aloofness,
and arguementative style may result in her feeling somewhat out of
step with those attributes more traditionally associated with
femininity. For an INTJ female to be true to herself may put her out
of step with the mainstream.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
As parents, INTJs' relentless pursuit for self-improvement becomes a
model for their children as well. They encourage a child's
independence and self-sufficiency, the sooner the better. What may be
seen by others as uncaring or unaffectionate is, to INTJs, the
ultimate in caring: teaching their children to stand on their own. The
situation may best be illustrated by the way in which an INTJ parent
likely teaches a child to swim. An INTJ parent may allow the child to
dive into deep water that other parents might consider risky -- all
the while supervising intently -- in the name of learning how to
swim. Other types may stick to shallower waters, wanting the child to
feel more comfortable in the learning process. To the INTJ, the issue
of comfort or fear is irrelevant. What's important is learning how to
swim. An old Chinese proverb was probably INTJ-inspired: "Give a man a
fish and he eats for a day; teach him to fish, and he eats for a
lifetime."

<br/>
<br/>	
		
<br/>
<br/>	
		
The same model drives all INTJ relationships: any relationship that's
good today can be better tomorrow and both parties must be directed to
constant self-improvement: learning, growing, confronting, and
anything else that leads to mutual self-competency. As lovers, mates,
and companions, INTJs must be ever improving. When thwarted in this
quest, they can become critical and often depressed over the seeming
stagnation.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
An INTJ's home reflects his or her current conceptual
pursuits. Theoretical and practical books abound. To a casual visitor,
the home may seem neat, but its more private corners reflect a series
of half-started projects, collections of mementos, and an assortment
of potential challenges: a guitar to be mastered, a file to be
organized, a household repair to be made. Dreams and visions are the
INTJ's form of relaxation. Unfortunately, seemingly ambitious plans
may go unfilled if the INTJ falls into the trap of being seduced by
the intellectual excitement of the plan without ever getting to the
actual hands-on accomplishment. Such a dilemma sets them up for
self-criticism, which leads, in turn, to frustration and depression.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJ children crave much of the same independence as their
parents. Unless their parents are of the same type, this quest may be
the root of an ongoing parent-child dispute. While sufficiently neat
to pass parental muster, their rooms may be laboratories of endless
explorations and experiments. For a parent to invade this territory
may be seen as an invasion of privacy and result in a struggle for
power. Often, in high school, INTJs can be "underachievers" who score
well on formal tests but are unstimulated by the details of day-to-day
classroom learning. Similarly, family events may be exciting if they
are stimulating and challenging, but the final decision on whether to
participate must lie with the INTJ child, not with his or her
parent. A lack of understanding this by both parties can cause
considerable tension. Clearly, in this context, such otherwise simple
decisions as when to go to bed or whether to attend a family function
can become major battlegrounds.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
For the INTJ, work is the laboratory in which blueprints become
reality -- and give way for new blueprints. Consequently, INTJ
managers strive to stimulate and stretch themselves and
subordinates. INTJ subordinates, in turn, strive to stimulate and
stretch themselves and their supervisors. They also want to be given a
free hand to experiment, and if too tightly controlled, may become
frustrated and resentful. They frequently master the language of
whatever it is in which they find themselves: whether managers or
counselors, they know all the correct words and phrases for situation
at hand.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
In short, the workplace is one more "system" that can be organized and
improved. As such, all assignments are undertaken with that underlying
expectation. When improvements are not forthcoming, the INTJ may be
subject to self-criticism. Careers particularly appealing to INTJs
include those that provide mental challenge (teaching, especially
college and research) and inventiveness in both business and science
(program analysts and architects). They can become restless and
frustrated in career choices that demand too much detail or a high
demand for personal services.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Midlife, as with most other types, finds a moderating of some
perferences. Their iNtuitive searching for the abstract begins to lean
toward a desire for immediate Sensing fulfillment. Similarly, they may
also "discover" the emotional and subjective sides of their Feeling
nonpreference, which may be at once exciting and frightening. Later
years could easily find INTJs inspiring themselves with more
sociability. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Best guesses of famous INTJs include Thomas Edison (who was given to
almost daily inventions, upon which he was always improving); Richard
Nixon (whose political genius made him a man ahead of his time, but
whose grasp for control ultimately undid him); and Katharine Hepburn
(whose private nature belies her take-charge, I'll-do-it-my-way
style).

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs, like their INFJ counterparts, are among the rarest of the
personality types, thought to comprise only 2-3% of the
population. More often than not, INTJs carry a y-chromosome,
outnumbering INTJ females at a clip of four to one.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Like other Intuitive Introverts, INTJs try to see the big picture and
look beyond appearances and superficialities. They place little stock
in outside or "expert" opinions, preferring to look inward for
answers. They feel they possess the inner tools and insights required
to independently determine truth. When they do consult outside
information, it is largely for the sake of confirming their own
insights. Because of their strength of mind, will, and insight, INTJs
may well be the most productive theorists of all types.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs often present as austere and impassive, displaying little as far
as variability of emotion or expression. Exuding an air of learnedness
and erudition, they may sometimes be perceived as intellectual snobs
or elitists. Perceptions of arrogance or aloofness notwithstanding,
their status as intellectuals is typically well-founded. Not only do
INTJs sport the highest collective IQ of all types, but they are
generally well-informed, displaying broad-ranging knowledge and
impressive memories. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
As left-brained masterminds, INTJs wield logic and language like
swords. They sport impressive vocabularies and precision in
articulation. They are undeterred from directly and firmly expressing
their viewpoints. At times, onlookers can be taken aback by their
directness, viewing them as opinionated, dogmatic, or closed-minded. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs can also be quite talkative (see this post) and witty. Some are
downright hilarious. Drawing on their memory for details and strong
oratory skills, INTJs can make for good storytellers. Like INFJs, they
enjoy employing stories, metaphors, and examples from popular culture
(Se) to help illustrate abstract concepts or ideas. This represents a
point of difference from their INTP counterparts, who, while witty,
are generally poor at delivering stories or jokes. INTJs who allow the
inner playfulness of their Ni to shine through will enjoy better
success with people, taking the edge off what can be perceived as
their sometimes harsh or insensitive Te.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
The type development of INTJs can be broadly conceived as follows:

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Phase I: Early in life, INTJs are characterized by a dominance of
their top two functions, which quickly make judgments and draw
conclusions about the world (Even though Ni is technically a
perceiving function, it often functions convergently, like a judging
function; see this post). During this phase of life, INTJs can seem
particularly inflexible and opinionated. Since their Ni/Te judgments
are not being weighed by and balanced against their tertiary Fi, they
can be quick to come to closure on a number of fronts. They are
generally far swifter than Perceivers in determining a career niche,
often involving an area of specialization. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Phase II: In the second phase of their development, INTJs
differentiate and incorporate their tertiary and inferior
functions. This often follows some sort of "midlife crisis" (note:
this may occur as early as their mid to late twenties) which compels
them toward greater openness. During this phase, their Te judgments
become softened as they become more open to feelings, both their own
and others (Fi; see this post). This paves the way for the development
and differentiation of their inferior function, Extraverted Sensation
(Se), in which they learn how to take life as it comes, letting go of
their need to constantly plan for and control the future. As they
develop and utilize their lower functions, INTJs may look and function
more like Perceivers, appearing more open, flexible, and relaxed. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Dominant Intuition (Ni) vs Inferior Sensing (Se): A Psychological
Tug-of-War 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Similar to INFJs, the INTJ psyche is best understood in terms of an
ongoing struggle between Intuition (N) and Sensing (S), or more
specifically, between their dominant function, Introverted Intuition
(Ni), and their inferior function, Extraverted Sensing (Se).1 Like
other types, INTJs tend to identify most strongly with their top two
functions and are often blind to the degree to which their inferior
function impacts their attitudes and behavior. In my view, the
paradoxical and contradictory behaviors evident in all types is best
understood in light of constant tug-of-war between the dominant and
inferior function. For INTJs, I have identified five categories that
illustrate the dialectic between the N and the S. These will comprise
the remainder of our discussion of the INTJ. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
1. Mind (N) vs. Body (S)

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Like INFJs, INTJs tend to downplay the importance of the body. They
often report feeling detached and disconnected from their
physicality. This makes INTJs and INFJs the most disposed to
out-of-body experiences. In commenting on INTJ philosopher and
novelist Jean Paul Sartre's work, Nausea, Thomas King, in his book
Jung's Four and Some Philosophers, writes: "The Introvert Intuitive is
discovering Sensation; his hands are alien to him and his body
unfamiliar."

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Assuming their environment permits it, INTJs can enter a trance-like
state in which they remain entirely unaware of their bodies. Unless
their body rebels against them, INTJs may go on functioning in a more
or less disembodied state for hours on end. For instance, founder of
Facebook and INTJ Mark Zuckerberg would reportedly spend upwards of
twenty consecutive hours perched in front of his computer. With the
exception of INFJs, this would be unheard of for any other type.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Because of their detachment from their physicality, INTJs may have
nightmares about unexpected declines in their health. One INTJ, for
instance, recounted to me his recurrent dreams of his teeth falling
out. Another reported his fear that he might develop a disease and be
unaware or ignorant of the symptoms until it was too late. Some INTJs
might forget to eat regularly and appear undernourished, while others
may overeat because of lack of attention to how often or how much they
are eating. In order to compensate for this mind-body disconnect,
INTJs may develop overly strict, even obsessive, regimens of diet and
exercise. Like other types, when trying to manage their inferior
function, INTJs can easily go to extremes. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
2. Metaphysical (N) vs. Physical (S)

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Despite being the most otherworldly and abstract of types, many INTJs
have a curious attraction to material goods, physical thrills, and
aesthetics (Se). They may drive fast cars, fly planes, and purchase
luxurious homes. They are more intrigued by fine food, art, and
architecture than INTPs, for whom Sensing is introverted. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
In the grip of their inferior Se, even the most responsible INTJ may
suddenly throw caution to the wind and turn to thrill seeking. They
may turn to drugs, alcohol, sex, pornography, extravagant vacations,
or shopping binges for the sake of indulging their Se. In such moments
of indulgence, they may resemble the "eat, drink, and be merry"
approach of ESP types. The difference is that INTJs tend to feel more
out of control when doing so. Such behavior is not characteristic of
who they see themselves to be. To guard against such extremes of their
inferior, they may again feel compelled to impose stringent rules on
their behavior in attempt to preserve their physical, mental, and/or
material well-being. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
3. Ideal (N) vs Actual (S); Reflection (N) vs. Action (S)

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Like INFJs, INTJs are visionaries and planners. They find their
intuitive visions incredibly beautiful and compelling, making it
difficult for them to accept anything less than perfection. To
actualize this ideal, they must find a way to transform it into a
tangible reality (Se). Unfortunately, because life is slow to conform
to their ideals, INTJs quickly learn that their visions are almost
always tarnished in the process of actualization. This leaves them
with two primary options. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
The first is to merely act as producers of ideals without concerning
themselves with their actualization. While this option may satisfy
their Ni, it fails to present them with tangible evidence of outer
change (Se) they desire. And since INTJs are wired to be change
agents, producing only ideas can often feel
unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, when faced with the alternative of
accepting a less than ideal product, many INTJs will settle for this
mode of operation, at least for a while. This may be why INTJ is the
most common type among academics, since the academy allows INTJs to
develop their theories independently of their application. Writing and
other artistic pursuits also provide INTJs with the opportunity to
express their ideals without concern for their direct
application. This was the option taken by INTJ philosopher Jean Paul
Sartre who found it nearly impossible to act: 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
"Indeed it is impossible for a determined process to act upon a
spontaneity (consciousness), exactly as it is impossible for objects
(S) to act upon consciousness (N). Thus any synthesis of two types of
existence is impossible; they are not homogenous; they will remain
each one its incommunicable solitude."

<br/>
<br/>	
		
The second option for INTJs is to actively work to implement their
ideas while being willing to accept something less than
perfection. This option, while frustrating to their Ni, is enticing to
their Se, which pushes for a tangible result or product. It also
introduces a new set of concerns. Namely, once the Ni ideal is no
longer ideal, at what point is it no longer acceptable? This question
is relevant to INTJs' work as well as their relationships. Those who
find the courage to act are constantly forced to grapple with whether
the product or relationship is acceptable or whether they should cut
their losses and start over. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
4. Universal/Whole (N) vs. Individual/Part (S)

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Intuition is more concerned with the big picture and the relationship
among the parts than it is with the parts themselves; it favors the
forest over the trees, the universals over the particulars. Of all
types, INTJs are most apt to discount personal experience (SFP) as a
valid form of evidence. They distrust anecdotal evidence and arguments
made in the name of "common sense." Rather, it is universal laws,
ideals, and theories, things they can know and understand through
their Ni and Te, that they are inclined to accept as truth. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
An INTJ friend of mine is a physical therapist, one whose Se inferior
got the best of him and landed him in a field dominated by
S-types. Nonetheless, in talking with John about his experiences, I
have gleaned some interesting insights about INTJs. One of his
assertions, very much contrary to conventional wisdom, is that a
therapist's level of experience (Si) is not all that important when it
comes to clinical expertise. Instead John feels that sound theoretical
understanding (N), one based on science and critical reasoning, is
what distinguishes the expert from the novice. The next, and perhaps
most egregious of John's perceived sins, is his insistence that he has
no way of knowing, without conducting some sort of formal study, if
his therapeutic approach to painful conditions actually works. This
points to his distrust of the subjective and anecdotal responses of
his patients. The last of John's soapboxes is his belief in the
relative unimportance of the physical evaluation when it comes to
helping patients with chronic pain. In his view, the problem is rarely
with any particular part (S), but with the interrelations of the
various parts (N), including the role of the mind. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
The INTJ preference for abstract universals stands in contradiction to
that of someone like Soren Kierkegaard (INFP). Kierkegaard was
convinced that living passionately according to one's own convictions
was far better than formulating universal theories. He viewed theories
and systematic thought as demoralizing, stripping human beings of
their most precious gift-their individuality. INTJs, especially those
who have yet to develop their tertiary Fi, are apt to disagree with
Kierkegaard, privileging the objective and universal over the
subjective and personal. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs downplaying of the individual is also evident in their own
lives. Especially early in their careers, many INTJ can be seen
prioritizing their work and accomplishments above all else. Many are
willing to sacrifice themselves, perhaps even their own health, for
the sake of achieving their career objectives. It is not until they
begin listening to and developing their Fi that they can truly
appreciate the more personal elements of life. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
5. Investigative Careers (N) vs. The Business World (S)

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Of all the IN types, INTJs are the most likely to end up the business
world, where they often function as managers or executives. My former
neighbor, at the time a corporate executive, worked long and grueling
hours. He was firm and assertive, rarely backing down from
confrontation. Considering his occupation, confidence, and
hard-driving persona, one might have initially suspected him an
ENTJ. I found myself pleasantly surprised when I learned of his
underlying philosophical and artistic bent and discovered that he was
actually an INTJ. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Many people are surprised, as I was with my neighbor, to see INTJs
going into business. After all, most INTJs pursue Investigative
careers (see this post) and business careers are generally pursued by
Sensing types. Despite this, the business world does provide INTJs
with opportunities to exercise many of their hallmark abilities. As
upper-level leaders, they can function as visionaries, strategic
planners, operations managers, systems thinkers, and the like. They
are also drawn into business for what are ultimately less healthy
reasons for the INTJ. Namely, their inferior Se, which revels in the
beauty and comfort of material things, is often a strong player in
their original decision to enter the business world. Not only do
careers in business promise material security, but they often include
opportunities for travel, fine meals, and attractive
accommodations. The thought of this lifestyle, even if largely
unconscious, can be quite appealing to INTJs' Se inferior. Since Se
might be equated with the ego in INJ types, it is not unreasonable to
suggest that success in the business world is sure to provide INTJs no
small amount of ego gratification. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
This sort of fatal attraction to business embodies INTJs' love-hate
relationship with the material world. On the one hand, they love the
novelties and sensory pleasures that the world has to offer. On the
other, they love the life of the mind and wish they did not have to
concern themselves with making money and working a less than ideal day
job. For this reason, we often see a midlife shift in INTJs, migrating
away from business and becoming more interested in investigative or
creative pursuits. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
http://www.16personalities.com/intj-relationships-dating

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJ personalities are likely to have significant difficulties when it
comes to relationships and dating. INTJs spend a large part of their
lives in their heads and consequently what they see and understand
intuitively can be much more advanced than a "bland" reality. As a
result, someone with the INTJ personality may find it challenging to
merge that fantasy and high requirements with reality. Unfortunately,
their superior logic and imagination may actually hinder the INTJ when
they start looking for a partner. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
People with this personality type are likely to apply a rational
approach to dating and relationships as well - an INTJ is likely to
have a "checklist" in their mind long before they actually start
thinking about a relationship. It is also likely that "he/she must be
rational" will be at the top of their list of criteria - and this is
exactly what usually holds the INTJ back, especially if they are
male. There are certain rules (e.g. do not appear too interested) and
types of behavior (e.g. a girl should not start the conversation
first) that a person interested in finding a dating partner is
expected to follow - and unfortunately for INTJs, the majority of
people will follow those rules. Even those potential partners who an
INTJ would normally see as rational will probably yield to societal
expectations. Consequently, INTJs are likely to get quite disappointed
after the first few attempts at dating and may even start thinking
that the opposite sex is either irrational or intellectually inferior.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Paradoxically, someone with the INTJ personality is most likely to
attract a romantic partner when they are not actually looking for
one. As most INTJs have difficulties with dating and relationships,
their self-confidence takes a major hit in those situations and the
INTJ then overcompensates by showing off their intelligence, which
makes them even more unattractive. Only when the INTJ returns to his
or her usual self, their self-confidence starts glowing again and this
makes it much easier for them to attract a partner.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs are uncomfortable expressing their feelings or trying to
understand the emotions of other people. They also have a tendency to
always trust their knowledge and understanding - not surprisingly,
INTJs can sometimes inadvertently hurt other people, especially during
the dating phase and even later in the relationship. The mind of the
INTJ personality is geared towards looking at conflict situations as
logical puzzles, worthy of analysis, which does not always help when
their relationship partner does not share the same notion of fun.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Sexually, INTJs are likely to be very imaginative and enthusiastic,
provided that their partner is willing to reciprocate. However, it is
important that the INTJ does not fall into a habit of spending more
time theorizing about intimacy than communicating with their partner. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
People with the INTJ personality type may terminate the relationship
if they are confident that it is at risk of breaking down, and not
look back. INTJs' approach to dating is quite similar - they will not
keep trying if their mind is telling them that the likelihood of a
strong relationship is very low. However, the calm exterior can be
deceiving - it is more than likely that the INTJ will feel very hurt
inside and spend extensive amounts of time figuring out what went
wrong, especially if they had devoted a lot of time to dating or
making the relationship work. 

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs are bewilderingly deep and intelligent people, bringing a lot of
stability and insight into their romantic relationships - but as
already mentioned, that extraordinary intelligence is their main enemy
in this area. That being said, if both partners manage to survive the
rocky start during the dating phase, it is very likely that the
relationship will be very deep and strong - and the INTJ will do
everything to ensure it stays that way, as long as the partner
reciprocates.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Preferred partners: ENFP and ENTP types, as E and P outweigh the
introvert and judgemental tendencies of INTJs. INFJs are also a very
strong match as the intuitive connection between INTJ and INFJ is
likely to be instantaneous.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
http://personalitycafe.com/intj-articles/10990-lenore-thomsons-intj-type-description.html

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Because INTJ's rely on Extraverted Thinking for their dealings with
the outer world, they often have a scientific, somewhat skeptical
approach to reality. They want to know how things work and what
they're likely to do under varying circumstances. Impatient with
wasted motion, words, and emotion, their outward demeanor may be
difficult to read.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Indeed, an INTJ's bearing can seem downright Vulcan. The Vulcans, of
course, are a fictional people in the Star Trek series - resolute
logicians who barely change expression or use body language, even when
they're puzzled or aware of danger. Thus, one might heed the words of
Tuvok, the Vulcan tactical officer on the spaceship Voyager, who
warns: "exterior composure is no indication of a Vulcan's inner
state".

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Although they superficially resemble Extraverted Thinkers, INTJs are
alway guided by their Intuition. They are rarely commited to general
assumotions about rules, laws, and hierarchy, and they may have an
acerbic sense of humor about such things. INTJs will use what works in
the service of their ideas; and they will quickly discard or change
what doesn't.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
A (probably apocryphal) story tells of a delegation of sailors who
went to the tribunal of the Inquisition in the seventeenth century,
when the Catholic Church had forbidden the use of Galileo's astronomy
as an affront to the Bible's account of creation. The sailos
sheepishly confessed that Galileo's theory had both simplified their
journeys and made their maps more accurate. They hoped that the
Inquisitors would exempt mariners from the church's proscription
against it. The Tribunal considered the problem, consulted with the
bishops, and sent an emissary to the Pope. Finally, they
conceded. They said, "OK, if the theory works, use it. But don't
believe it".  This is a pretty fair description of the INTJ's basic
attitude. Fundamental truth is something different from expressed
knowledge, which is always a fiction of one sort or another. If a
theory works, it doesn't matter who supports it or what anyone thinks
it means. If it doesn't, why bother with it?

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Although both INTJs and ENTJs realize their Intuitions by way of
rational criteria - principles, law, organizational structure, and so
forth - ENTJs will not usually pursue a goal unless it strikes them as
compatible with reason. INTJs are more classicaly Promethean. They
will steal fire from the gods without any assurance that a reasonable
hearth exists at which to tend it back home. For such types, knowledge
is not information, but a way of looking at things.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Consider James Hillman's understanding of the soul as "a perspective
rather than a susbstance, a viewpoint toward things rather than a
thing itself". This is a typically INTJ antidefinition. Such types may
expend a great deal of time attempting to winnow the actual logic of
accepted theories and formulations from expedient or merely limited
assumptions. INTJs are accordingly drawn to science, mathematics, and
medicine - fields in which new ideas about reality are constantly
being forged and tested logically. They may also take interest in
psychology, theology, publishing, and linguistics. As they pursue
their intuitions, they inevitably combine elements from varied fields,
perceiving an underlying commonality of form or meaning.

<br/>
<br/>			

This sense of underlying structure and meaning leads INTJs to value
both elegance of form and subtlety of expression. Nothing exists that
can't bear reediting and paring down to its essential components. The
connections INTJs perceive among very different areas of knowledge may
be sufficient to convice them they're headed in the right direction,
even when they can't explain what they're after.

<br/>
<br/>			

Like the ISTJs, INTJs cannot accept new information until they relate
it to their inner world. However, ISTJs analyze new data by aligning
it with what they already know. Once they've accepted a fact, it
becomes part of their identity. INTJs explore information largely by
rejecting its influence - examining it from other perspectives and
determining its limitations.

<br/>
<br/>			

Because this inner process is tied to their sense of self, INTJs can
take a long time to figure out "who they really are". Their need to
find out "what's missing" from a system of information invariably
takes them into their own mental world - to an imaginative
reconstruction of ideas - and the effort necessarily becomes a search
for part of themselves. Such types can develop the destructive habit
of formulating their identity in terms of their ability to see a
situation's limits, needing to find the flaws that will allow them to
become spectators rather than performers.

<br/>
<br/>			

For this reason, others don't usually recognize the need of the
average INTJ for external structure. INTJs are invariably described as
independent and self-motivated, and this is certainly true with
respect to their strongest functions. Where technical and intellectual
competence are concerned, INTJs have a kind of inner compass, and they
prefer a situation in which they don't have to coordinate their work
with or report to someone else.

<br/>
<br/>			

Moreover, they don't take criticism of their ideas
personally. Position, title, and reputation have no meaning for these
types. They will not entertain another's judgement of theur worth
unless they believe the person intellectualy qualified to make the
assessment. And even a legitimate judgement will usually strike them
as an indication of the other person's assumptions and expectations.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Personal relatedness, however, is a different matter. INTJs are much
less confident in a purely social situation. It is no exaggeration to
say that their primary relationship is to their inner world, and they
will nurture that relationship at the considerable expense of social
abilities and the art of compromise.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
In a field that excites and interests them, they are often driven, and
they tend to expect the same degree of investment from
subordinates. They frequently convey impatience when a situation that
had seemed impersonal and outwardly predictable suddenly requires
free-form personal interaction.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs don't like to say something more than once, and they may cut
others short when conversation strikes them as unnecessary. Moreover,
their need to find an alternate point of view in order to understand
something can sound like disagreement or negativity - as though the
speaker's ideas had been judged and found wanting. Thus, even people
who know an INTJ well may believe the person is either indifferent to
them or critical of them.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs can also be lonely behind their reserve, not knowing how to fit
in even when they want to be included. This aspect of the type is
partly the result of the INTJ's comparative rarity. At 1% of the
population, INTJs are usually the only one of their kind in a
family. Throughout grammar and high school, they are often the only
such type in a classroom.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Altough this ratio changes at the college and graduate level, when
INTJs specialize in fields that appeal to other INJs, for most of
their developing years, these types have good reason to feel different
from others. Because they relate to the outer world with Extraverted
Thinking, they generally interact by trying to determine the logical
relationship of others' views and demands to their own
needs. Consequently, they get little experience in areas of
relationship that don't interest them.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Many such types become articulate quite early, and they use their
verbal abilites to fend off involvment in anything they don't
understand or don't wish to. However, their awareness of others'
feelings does not keep pace with their verbal abilities. Young INTJs
may be intelectually precocious but emotionally imature, exercising
their dominant function by distancing themselves from others, engaging
in ironic comments and somewhat juvenile sarcasm.

<br/>
<br/>			

Sometimes, to their surprise, their observations make people laugh and
afford them the group approval they were attempting to preempt. INTJs
rather enjoy the paradox this sets up and will play to it -
experimenting with the boundaries of humor itself. One might consider
comedian Dennis Miller, who presents himself as a caustic observer and
occasional saboteur of the images and conventions on which his
livelyhood depends.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Like all types, INTJs resist their least-developed functions and
attempt to avoid situations in which they'll come into play. It should
be granted, however, that Sensation and Feeling, the INTJ's weakest
functions, cannot be avoided wholesale in the course of a normal human
life. These functions are our means of concrete embodiement - our
physical pleasures and desires, our emotional connections with others,
our love of home and hearth, our sense of being grounded and real.

<br/>
<br/>			

INTJs appreciate these things well enough, but more in the abstract
than in the messy realitites of everyday existence. Regarding most
events as arbitrary arrangements of elements, to be dismantled and
reassembled at will, they may find it difficult to assume the duration
of another's affection or interest in them.

<br/>
<br/>		 

In general, these types deal with feelings the way they deal with
ideas - by formulating and explaining them to themselves so they know
what to expect, or getting far enough outside them to resist their
influence. In an INTJ's mind, friendships require a particular kind of
investment; sexual connections another; marriage another. Such types
want to know which category they're dealing with before they get
involved.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
But real relationship is unpredictable, and real people resist the
categories the INTJ attempts to apply. In fact, sexual attraction and
romantic infatuation usually catch these types by surprise. And
although they enjoy the distinct pleasures of sensuality, the
careening roller coaster of emotions that comes with the territory
ultimately forces them to use their inferior functions.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
As opposed to their usual view of reality as arbitrary, they begin to
experience the influence of primitive Extraverted Sensation and feel
an anxious sense of material possession. They feel impulsive, out of
control, and unable to take anything for granted. They worry that
their intellectual life will never get back on track until the
relationship becomes more ordinary and settled. Ultimately, they
attempt to regain control - by pressing for declarations and
permanency, even if their own intentions aren't clear to them yet, or
by using their critical judgement to distance themselves from their
emotions.

<br/>
<br/>			

INTJs appreciate the security of a commited relationship, and given
the ration of Extraverts to Introverts in our culture, often marry
Extraverted types. They enjoy their families and mantain an unusual
respect for the individuality and independence of both spouse and
children. However, they may not sustain the kind of Extraverted
interaction their partner expects.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
They're more likely to settle in and, at their first opportunity ,
reassert their primary relationship to their inner world. This is true
of both male and female INTJs. When there is too much outer
stimulation or conflict, INTJs lose touch with their intuitive process
and become restless, bored, and emotionally exhausted. Thus, INTJs
need a fair amount of time alone.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
They also need a fair amount of intellectual challenge and
exercise. If a partner can't provide it, INTJs are likely to seek it
privately or with others. The same INTJ who gets bored at parties and
looks around for the nearest bookshelf may well forget to eat or
sleepn when involved in a complex and intricate conversation about
ideas. In fact, for an INTJ, the communion of like minds is a kind of
cerebral analog to falling in love.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
INTJs may even resist concomitant physical attraction to a kindred
spirit for fear of compromising the relationship with the exigencies
of chemistry and social expectation. Such types frequently envision an
ideal way of life that would unify NTJ cerebralism with SFP physical
immediacy, but in actual practice, they are most likely to understand
such unification as something ultimately spiritual. For this reason,
INTJs may have an abiding interest in Sufism, or the Buddhist warrior
philosophy, or the kind of mystical poetry that celebrates this
idealized state in language.

<br/>
<br/>	
		
Ironically, INTJs can best engage their Feeling and Sensate qualities
by developing more Extraverted Thinking. The inner world if an INTJ is
so compelling that such types can let their physical and emotional
needs go for long periods of time. Deliberate use of Extraverted
Thinking gives them more of what they need - a senser of rootedness in
the material world: the world of bills, train schedules, medical and
dental appointments, shoe repair, and the like. As the Zen Buddhists
are wont to say, "after ecstasy, the laundry."

<br/>
<br/>			

Extraverted Thinking also connects them to the assumptions and
expectations of others, so they are better able to analyze people's
expressions and behaviors for social cues. Many INTJs find, for
example, that their carrer ambitions push them into developing a
serviceable repertoire of behaviors that convey goodwill and put
people at ease. Ultimately, these behaviors are more predictable than
the abstract categories of relationship INTJs are inclined to devise.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>			

When Extraverted Thinking isn't working well enough, INTJs draw
directly from their tertiary function, Introverted Feeling, which
merely rationalizes and supports their worst tendencies. It encourages
them to idealize their abstract ideas about life and to avoid real
relationships as unworthy of their investment. Such INTJs are often
credited with staying above the emotional fray of life, when they have
actually never been in it.

<br/>
<br/>			

INTJs are the most self-confident of all types, having “self-power"
awareness. Found in about 1 percent of the general population, the
INTJs live in an introspective reality, focusing on possibilities,
using thinking in the form of empirical logic, and preferring that
events and people serve some positive use. Decisions come naturally to
INTJs’ once a decision is made, INTJs are at rest. INTJs look to the
future rather than the past, and a word which captures the essence of
INTJs is builder-a builder of systems and the applier of theoretical
models.

<br/>
<br/>			

To INTJs authority based on position, rank, title, or publication has
absolutely no force. This type is not likely to succumb to the magic
of slogans, watchwords, or shibboleths. If an idea or position makes
sense to an INTJ, it will be adopted, if it doesn’t, it won’t,
regardless of who took the position or generated the idea. As with the
INTP, authority per se does not impress the INTJ.

<br/>
<br/>			

INTJs do, however, tend to conform to rules if they are useful, not
because they believe in them, or because they make sense, but because
of their unique view of reality. They are the supreme pragmatists, who
see reality as something which is quite arbitrary and made up. Thus it
can be used as a tool-or ignored. Reality is quite malleable and can
be changed, conquered, or brought to heel. Reality is a crucible for
the refining of ideas, and in this sense, INTJs are the most
theoretical of all the types. Where an ESTP sees ideas as the pawn of
reality, an INTJ sees reality as the pawn of ideas: No idea is too
far-fetched to be entertained. INTJs are natural brainstormers, always
open to new concepts and, in fact, aggressively seeking them.

INTJs manipulate the world of theory as if on a gigantic chess board,
always seeking strategies and tactics that have high payoff. In their
penchant for logic, the INTJs resemble the INTPs. The logic of an
INTJ, however, is not confined to the expressible logical. Unlike
INTPs, INTJs need only to have a vague, intuitive impression of the
unexpressed logic of a system to continue surely on their way. Things
need only seem logical; this is entirely sufficient. Moreover, they
always have a keen eye for the consequence of the application of new
ideas or positions. They can be quite ruthless in the implementation
of systems, seldom counting personal cost in terms of time and
energy. Theories which cannot be made to work are quickly discarded by
the INTJs.

<br/>
<br/>			

To understand INTJs, their way of dealing with ideas should be
observed closely. Their conscious thought is extraverted and
empirical. Hence, they are better at generalizing, classifying,
summarizing, adducing evidence, proving, and demonstrating than are
the INTPs. The INTJs are somewhat less at home with pure reason, that
is, systemic logic, where principles are explicit. In this respect
they resemble the ENTJs. The INTJs, rather than using deductive logic,
use their intuition to grasp coherence.

<br/>
<br/>			

INTJs can be very single-minded at times; this can be either a
weakness or a strength in their careers, for they can ignore the
points of view and wishes of others. INTJs usually rise to positions
of responsibility, for they work long and hard and are steady in their
pursuit of goals, sparing neither time nor effort on their part or
that of their colleagues and employees. INTJs live to see systems
translated into substance; an INTP, by way of contrast, is content to
design the system. In both these types, however, coherence is the
master. Both internal and external consistency are important, and if
an INTJ finds that he or she is in a working situation where
overlapping functions, duplication of effort, inefficient paper flow,
and waste of human and material resources abound, the INTJ cannot rest
until an effort is made to correct the situation.

<br/>
<br/>			

Mates

<br/>
<br/>			

Wishing to control nature, the INTJ “scientist" probably has more
difficulty than all other types in making up his or her mind in mate
selection. Even mate selection must be done in a scientific way. It
may well be that the narratives, plays, and films impugning the
“rational and objective" approach to mating have as their target our
thorough-going scientist INTJ. Nevertheless, when young, the INTJ is
attracted to the free-wheeling, spontaneous, fun-loving “entertainer"
ESFP.

<br/>
<br/>			

But the INTJ requires that mating meet certain criteria, else it is
not undertaken. So the INTJ doesn't often go through with what is
begun by natural attraction. Since he or she proceeds in a rational
and methodical way, the selection of a similar temperament is more
likely than selection of opposite, following the assumption that those
who are similar ought to do well together. The INTJ “scientist" is
also attracted to the ENFP “journalist," probably because of the
enthusiastic, effervescent, and apparently spontaneous enjoyment and
wonderment this type exudes-the very antitheses of the careful,
thoughtful exactitude of the INTJ.

The INTJ

<br/>
<br/>			

We have just looked at the dominant forces of our society and have
seen that state and church are giving way to science, technology,
psychology and entertainment. We have also examined three of the four
iNtuitive, Introverted MBTI types. I suggest that these two topics are
related. In fact, I suggest that each of the four candidates for
replacing state and church has transformed one of the four iNtuitive
Introverted MBTI categories. 

<br/>
<br/>			

We have already noticed that the INTP naturally gravitates toward
science. In other words, the discovery of science has opened up a new
world for the INTP. Before, all he could do was study books and use
Perceiver logic to analyze their contents-as in the scholasticism of
the Middle Ages. Science allows him to go beyond the bookworm
stage. It shows him that the entire external world is 'written' with
iNtuitive sentences, and that he can use internal Thinking to 'read'
this 'book' of Nature. 

<br/>
<br/>			

The INFJ has gone through a similar transformation. Initially, his
only option was philosophy-building theories out of semi-deluded
self-analysis. But, psychology has allowed him to escape from his
self-constructed prison by showing him that he can extend his analysis
to other people. Instead of abandoning self to the introspection of
navel-gazing, he can broaden his horizons by studying the behavior of
society. 

<br/>
<br/>			

With this in mind, let us turn to the INTJ-the fourth iNtuitive
Introverted MBTI type. I suggest that the transformation of his
thinking is especially significant because it has happened in our
lifetime. We will begin by describing the natural INTJ, and then show
how technology has given him a new lease on life. 

<br/>
<br/>			

As usual we will start with the auxiliary or mental assumption, which
in this case is Extraverted Thinking. Remember that the MBTI
categories, according to MBTI theory, are all 'either-or'-a person
uses either one mode or another, but not both. Thus, the INTJ uses
Thinking with the external world and suppresses external Feeling. In
other words, he approaches his external environment objectively and
ignores all subjective emotional Mercy experiences. 

<br/>
<br/>			

Obviously, such a person is not swayed by emotional status. Most
people accept the opinions and pronouncements of established
authorities. The INTJ does not. He tries to look beyond the 'experts'
and discover the real facts. He uses logic to evaluate his beliefs,
thank you very much. 

<br/>
<br/>			

This viewpoint gives the INTJ an unusual view of reality. Unlike
others, he does not fixate upon specific Mercy experiences. As far he
is concerned, what really matters is the Perceiver facts that lie
behind those experiences. One positive result is external
flexibility. He knows that the situations of life can change, and he
is equipped to adapt when they do. 

<br/>
<br/>			

Unfortunately, this seemingly 'rational' approach of the typical INTJ
is full of hypocrisy. This is because, like Spock of Star Trek, the
logical INTJ has a 'human mother.' Remember that Mercy strategy is the
first to develop in a child. All other mental programming grows from
this emotional core. Because the INTJ was also a young child at one
time, this emotional foundation lives in him as well. Therefore, when
the INTJ suppresses external Feeling and focuses upon external
Thinking, he is showing others the logical periphery of his mind while
at the same time pretending that the emotional core does not exist. 

<br/>
<br/>			

How can one know that this emotional foundation is there? Because the
INTJ is a private person who is easily hurt. If he had no subjective
emotional core, then he would not need to keep his personal life
hidden. But, he is very sensitive to rejection from those with whom he
has emotional ties. This shows that his mind really is integrated
around personal feelings.  I speak here from personal experience, for,
as far as I can tell, I began life as an INTJ. In fact, I suggest that
most INTJs are either Perceiver or Contributor persons. Why? Because
these two styles both have conscious access to Perceiver thought and
they can both see how vulnerable Perceiver confidence is to Mercy
pressure. Thus, it is natural for these two styles to emphasize what
is conscious, and then defend it by suppressing subjective feeling.

<br/>
<br/>			

So, am I a typical INTJ hypocrite? Not any more. For years I have
struggled to escape from the emotional suppression practiced by the
INTJ by integrating facts with feeling. To the extent that I have
succeeded in bridging T/F through personal transformation, to that
extent I have emerged from the fundamental hypocrisy of the INTJ.

<br/>
<br/>			

Moving further, hidden within the T/F separation of the typical INTJ
is a P/J split. This is because the mental operation of the INTJ
depends upon the subjective core that he suppresses. Remember that
Perceiver facts cannot ever exist as independent entities. Rather,
they are connections between Mercy memories. Facts are gathered as
Perceiver strategy looks through its 'window' into Mercy thought and
notices similarities and differences in the ever-flowing stream of
Mercy experiences. But what determines which experiences flow by
Perceiver thought? Exhorter strategy. Exhorter mode is naturally
attracted to experiences with strong emotions. These fill Mercy
thought and are then categorized by Perceiver thinking.  Therefore,
the attention of the INTJ is driven by the very subjective core that
he is suppressing. Subconsciously, in Mercy and Exhorter thought, his
mind is continually being attracted to emotional situations in his
environment. The INTJ responds by suppressing the feelings and working
out the facts. In order to Judge the external world, his mind must
always contain a subconscious, suppressed fragment which operates in
MBTI Perceiving.  Others sense this emotional suppression as a sort of
generalized condemnation. Let me explain. When the INTJ uses Perceiver
strategy to learn facts about people, he is constructing mental
'self-images' about them. What type of self-image does the INTJ
impose upon others? One which despises personal feelings and which
rejects those who express themselves emotionally.

<br/>
<br/>			

Perceiver facts, by their very nature, apply equally to all Mercy
situations. Therefore, this same self-image will be imposed upon the
subjective identity of the INTJ himself-a self-image which suppresses
external Feeling. Therefore, deep down, the INTJ will know that he has
no right to exist in the external world as a person. Notice exactly
what is being suppressed. Not the internal feelings of the INTJ. These
continue to exist in privacy. Rather, it is his external existence as
a living, breathing, feeling person that is being mentally
condemned. The INTJ thinks that he will never lead a normal life.
Obviously, no one can live with such a conclusion. But, this is what
logic states, and the INTJ assumes that logic applies. Therefore the
nagging doubt always remains-I am not a person; I will never have a
'normal life.' This fatalism can affect the relationship of the INTJ
with members of the opposite sex. On the one hand, he finds it
difficult to interact emotionally with others. On the other hand, his
self-image predicts that he will never be able to interact emotionally
with others. One can see why the INTJ is so sensitive to personal
rejection from friends.

<br/>
<br/>			

Let us turn our attention now to the dominant mode of Introverted
iNtuition. What does the INTJ do with the collection of Perceiver
facts provided by Extraverted Thinking? He builds an internal world of
possibilities, free of any emotional attachment to external
idols. This happens in both Mercy and Teacher thought. On the one
side, Perceiver facts re-link Mercy experiences and create internal
images of what could be. What type of images? Ones that can be
implemented in the real world, for these images were created by facts
that were acquired through rational external observation. On the other
side, whenever Teacher thought in the INTJ is faced with a pile of
Perceiver bricks, it is emotionally motivated to build them into a
general structure. These theories can usually be applied externally,
because they are constructed out of mental bricks that came from the
external world. And, because Perceiver strategy hates redundancy,
these theories are usually free of repetition and overlap. Also,
because of their basis in Perceiver analysis of rational external
observation, there is a freedom from emotional idols.

<br/>
<br/>			

While the INTJ appreciates logic, he lacks the motivation to restrict
his thinking to the dry reasoning of higher math and formal logic
often pursued by the INTP, who uses the same mental modes of N and T,
but switches the dominant and auxiliary. The reason for this is
interesting. The INTJ gains most of his facts by analyzing emotional
situations from the external world. If he tried to focus upon internal
rules of logic, he would have to use confidence to direct subconscious
attention away from the external stream of emotional Mercy
events. This would be a losing battle, because emotionally driven
Exhorter excitement will almost always win out eventually over
Perceiver inhibition. However, if the INTJ can use internal iNtuition
to build internal theories and visions, then this internally generated
Teacher and Mercy feeling can pull the attention of subconscious
Exhorter thought away from the stream of external Mercy input.

<br/>
<br/>			

In fact, if these internally produced feelings are strong enough, then
the internal world will become the main focus of subconscious Exhorter
attention. As a result, the ideas of the INTJ often acquire a life of
their own-Exhorter strategy finds internal emotion exciting, this
drives his mind, he acquires more facts, these add to internal
structure and create more excitement for Exhorter thought.

<br/>
<br/>			

The INTJ may be good at building internal structure, but he has
problems when it comes to implementation. On the one hand, he is
motivated to apply his theories and visions. This is because they are
constructed out of facts gleaned from the external world. Therefore,
by applying the theory or vision, the INTJ would gain more external
facts.

<br/>
<br/>			

On the other hand, the ideas of the INTJ lack two critical
components. First, they exclude human feelings. Thus, the INTJ finds
it easiest to apply his ideas in areas of life which are
objective. Second, they gloss over Server skills. The INTJ may know
what is logical, but he has a much weaker grasp of what is
doable. Therefore, the ideas of the INTJ are usually applied to
organizations and institutions, because these entities ignore personal
feelings and they maintain a distinction between instructions and
actions. Here, he can focus on words and know that actions, by others,
will follow.

<br/>
<br/>			

Let us look now at the way in which technology has transformed the
INTJ. We will focus upon consumer electronics because these attract
the attention of the INTJ most strongly. First, there is an external
world full of Perceiver objects. Electronic stores are filled with
'black boxes' such as audio equipment, video gadgetry and high-tech
computers. These devices are completely free of Mercy emotions and
obey only Perceiver logic. This satisfies the INTJ's auxiliary mode of
Extraverted Thinking.

<br/>
<br/>			

Second, consumer electronics provide a continuing stream of novel and
improved devices. Almost every day, new gadgets appear which make old
ones obsolete. Thus, not only is auxiliary Thinking satisfied, but
there is enough externally generated novelty and excitement to keep
subconscious Exhorter strategy fixated.

<br/>
<br/>			

Third, there are iNtuitive possibilities. Electronic devices can be
assembled to form systems. In other words, these Perceiver objects can
be tied together to form both awe-inspiring examples of Teacher
order-within-complexity and amazing exhibits of Mercy wonder. Simply
imagining these possibilities is sufficient to quicken the heartbeat
of the INTJ.

<br/>
<br/>			

Fourth, there is a minimum of Server skills. Assembling electronic
components does not require years of practice. A modicum of manual
dexterity is sufficient. In fact, most electronic components fit
together like building blocks. Thus, the INTJ finds that iNtuitive
thought, apart from Sensing, is sufficient to allow him to enter the
magical world of electronics.

<br/>
<br/>			

Fifth, not only is iNtuition sufficient, but it is also
necessary. With mechanical devices, you can observe gears turning and
rods moving. When they need fixing, you can usually see where the
problem is. This triggers Sensing. In contrast, electronic devices
work invisibly. You cannot use Sensing either to observe or to
understand them. Instead, you must use iNtuition to imagine how they
do or do not work, based upon the few physical components that you can
actually see, and the connections between them.

<br/>
<br/>			

Finally, programmable electronics, such as computers, are actually
controlled through iNtuition. Very little physical movement is
required. Instead, you type in verbal instructions, or use the mouse
to manipulate symbolic objects that can be seen on the screen.

<br/>
<br/>			

You can see why the INTJ turns easily into a techno-freak. Technology
transforms his mode of thought and frees him from emotional contact
with people. This does not mean that the INTJ avoids all
individuals. He is always happy to interact with those who share his
technical bias, because this interaction focuses upon facts and
derives its emotional pleasure from technical possibility.

<br/>
<br/>			

http://charitysplace.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/intjs-relationships/

<br/>
<br/>			

Can an INTJ have a romantic relationship?

<br/>
<br/>			

Yes, but the choice to BE romantic will go through a filter of logic
first. The INTJ doesn't "fall in love," but is "attracted," and then
chooses whether or not get involved on an emotional level. If an INTJ
doesn't see the purpose in exploring a romantic relationship, they
won't do it, for reasons of practicality. (Does this fit with my long
term goals? Would their irritating habits annoy me after awhile? Our
we compatible with one another? Do our finances align?) 

<br/>
<br/>			

INTJs don't form relationships just for the sake of relationships;
they form relationships for what a person brings into their life, and
if they don't see any sort of benefit from it either in the immediate
or distant future, they won't pursue it. Generally, they know what
they want and anyone who isn't that will be discarded.

<br/>
<br/>			

Can an INTJ fall in love?

<br/>
<br/>			

The INTJ doesn't really fall in love but choose to pursue it if it's attainable and beneficial. Their manner of showing love tends to be more practical than romantic (doing things for someone else, as opposed to buying flowers).

<br/>
<br/>			

INTJs can't maintain relationships.

<br/>
<br/>			

If this is suspected by other types, it's more likely incompatibilities between personalities are at fault. An INTJ is more than willing to keep up a mutually beneficial relationship so long as it provides them with mental stimulation and others are forgiving of their bluntness.

<br/>
<br/>			

Other types should understand and remember these key aspects to the
INTJ personality:

<br/>
<br/>			

- Be honest if they hurt your feelings.

<br/>
<br/>			

- Accept that at times, they'll be tactless.

<br/>
<br/>			

- Don't play games with them. You'll start it, they'll finish it, and
you won't like how it ends.

<br/>
<br/>			

- Be consistent in your behavior. Don't be friendly one day and icy
the next. They have very little tolerance for emotional fluxes, which
means they won't try and "fix" the relationship - they'll quit the
relationship.

<br/>
<br/>			

- Tell them what you want from them. Don't expect them to figure it
out. If you want more than they can give, they'll be honest with you
and tell you so.

<br/>
<br/>			

- The more they respect you as a person, the more forgiving they'll be
of conflict and the less inclined they'll be to cause trouble.

<br/>
<br/>			

How to know if you are in a good relationship with an INTJ:

<br/>
<br/>			

They don't avoid you. They actively seek to involve you in our
life. They try not to hurt your feelings and apologize if they find
out that they did.
