We utilize a statistical method to generate this MBTI result,
consequently, the result is only as good as available data. The data
is in the form of celebrity birthdays / MBTI type correlation. For
more accurate results, it is strongly advised to take the Questionaire
accessible from the main page of our app.

As a side note: We find the statistical result is usually, at worst
wrong by one letter. If ESTJ is reported for example, the real type
could also be ENTJ, or ESTP, ISTJ, etc.
