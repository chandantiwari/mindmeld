Birthday:sign database is the pocketbudda.dat file. This file is
generated by processing / combining lewi.dat and other lookups. Other
lookups are Chinese and Spiller signs which use src/scripts/chinese,
spiller files. Millman sign is calculated on-the-fly, at runtime for
each birtdate.

lewi.dat file is generated using jlewi project on github.

Android project is just a WebView wrapper for the Pocketbudda Appspot URL.

The Python appspot files are under the app folder. In order to run the
site, you start dev server using this folder. localhost:8080 will
connect to the main site, localhost:8080/mobile will connect to the
mobile site. Android code directly connects to this site.

Dev needs a astro symlink to mweb directory. 

In order to test the "friends" section, Facebook Connect functionality
is needed. The Pocketbudda App on Facebook expects a certain URL,
therefore the Javascript connector code on our side needs to think it
is working with the real site. But this can easily faked by placing
"127.0.0.1 pocketbudda.appspot.com" in the local /etc/hosts file. Then
we visit the site URL which will direct us to out local server. One
more caveat: You need to run your server on port 80 (since we are the
*real" site now) which means using --port=80, on Linux, and for that,
you will have to start the server with "sudo" otherwise Linux wont let
access to that port. This is not a big deal tho.

The mobile site is on:

http://pocketbudda.appspot.com

A Django based site for larger screens
