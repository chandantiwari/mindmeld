<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Brilliant and powerful leaders or dynamic creative advisers, these individuals
can solve long-standing problems, create new options, and open doors to a better
world. Money isn't the main issue for them; they apply their energy, and there's
always enough. They give and receive without keeping track of the score, and
they attract others with their powerful energy field. They help empower others,
and they share abundantly. They've learned to lead from a position of equality
and mutual respect. Driving the material success path with a tidal wave of
energy makes for an exciting, productive life.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals outmaneuver, outcompete, and overcontrol others, often through
manipulation. Too unsure to put themselves on the line, they deny their power
and sabotage their success or, alternately, they exploit their power and seek to
achieve success by dominating or outshining others. Avoiding exercise, they
struggle with addictions due to blocked creative energy. Frustrated by pent-up
energy, they alienate others due to an aloof, negative exterior, but underneath
churn gnawing self-doubts and insecurities.
