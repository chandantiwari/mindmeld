<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Strong, practical, physical, and spiritual, these individuals have learned to
trust the mystery and wisdom of life working through them and through everyone
else. These freethinkers trust in the process of their life, including the ups
and downs, the difficulties and joys. Meditation, which quiets their mind,
brings a sense of harmony and peace as a regular part of their life. Combining
worldly interests with a commitment toward inner growth, these individuals
dedicate their work, relationships, and activities to growth and awakening. They
share their insightful nature based on direct experience and feel connected to
Spirit even while pursuing the practical concerns of everyday life.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals feel torn between conflicting drives for security and desires
to go inward and get away from the material world. Confused and troubled by a
human world they don't trust, they see hypocrisy everywhere, reflecting the
turmoil they feel inside. Self-doubt only aggravates self-trust issues, so they
constantly look for teachers, techniques, and ideas that can help them; they
become wandering spiritual vagabonds, seldom putting down roots long enough for
anything to grow in their lives. Alternately, they want nothing to do with
"crazy" spiritual things. Even though they may appear sociable and gregarious,
they are wary of sharing their feelings and end up feeling alone.
