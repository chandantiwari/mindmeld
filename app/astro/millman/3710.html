<h3>37/10</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
In the positive, 37/10s bring a lightness and energy to those they
contact. Trusting themselves and the energy working through them, they walk
forward confidently and lightly, with the faith that even if they make a
mistake, it's a natural part of their path. They have the courage and openness
to express their deepest feelings and communicate their inner needs directly and
clearly, creating trust based on understanding. They feel joy in their expanding
gifts and creativity, which enables them to do refined work in healing or other
fields as they tune into other people and feel a deepening connection with the
natural world. This healing may take many forms, such as art, music, drama, or
other aesthetic forms of expression.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Starting out as naively trusting seekers, these individuals withdraw from others
out of insecurity and fear of being embarrassed, so the very betrayal they fear
comes true. Not revealing their feelings, they find or perceive that people
misunderstand or even mistrust them. Angry or depressed with themselves, they
have disturbing dreams, which reveal the shadow side they fear. They also feel
repressed bitterness about relationships, and they struggle with blocked,
frustrated creative energies. Physical maladies may force them to confront
issues of health.
