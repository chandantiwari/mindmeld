    The Achilles Heel of these people is looking for their sense of self worth
    through others' approval. They need to give up on getting themselves tangled
    up in other people's doings and focus on themselves, walk on their own
    path. These people look for a co-dependent relationship, but first, they
    must understand his/her own needs, to distinquish self, then get into the
    relationship.
