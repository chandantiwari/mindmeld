  Achilles Heel of these people is dependence. The need of being looked after
  can force these people in a unending quest for security. They develop
  attachements, dependence on other people, forcing them to be the center of
  their security. But this is a bottomless hole. This person must accept
  responsibility, be willing to take risks and take responsibility for managing
  and reaching their goals on something. These people long for a sense of
  belonging but they need to understand a special person or a group will not
  provide this just because of their need. Instead, they must take
  responsibility of creating that which they have a need for.
