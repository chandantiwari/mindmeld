    The Achilles Heel of these people is their constant need for order and this
    can push them on an unending quest for perfection of life. But since life
    never fits any one person's idea of order, they can never feel comfortable
    enough to let go; they keep postponing their happiness. They need to accept
    that Cosmos's (or evolving life dynamics') plan is always the right one and
    better than theirs. When they see this, they also realize the see the bigger
    picture and as a result let go, be happy.
