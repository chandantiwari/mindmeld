<h3>Rational</h3>

Rationals, being abstract in communicating and utilitarian in implementing
goals, can become highly skilled in strategic analysis. Thus their most
practiced and developed intelligent operations tend to be marshalling and
planning (NTJ organizing), or inventing and configuring (NTP engineering). And
they would if they could be wizards in one of these forms of rational
operation. They are proud of themselves in the degree they are competent in
action, respect themselves in the degree they are autonomous, and feel confident
of themselves in the degree they are strong willed. Ever in search of knowledge,
this is the "Knowledge Seeking Personality"-trusting in reason and hungering for
achievement. They are usually pragmatic about the present, skeptical about the
future, solipsistic about the past, and their preferred time and place are the
interval and the intersection. Educationally they go for the sciences,
avocationally for technology, and vocationally for systems work. Rationals tend
to be individualizing as parents, mindmates as spouses, and learning oriented as
children. Rationals are very infrequent, comprising as few as 5% and no more
than 7% of the population.
