<h3>ENFJ</h3>

http://typelogic.com/enfj.html
<br/>
<br/>
ENFJs are the benevolent 'pedagogues' of humanity. They have tremendous charisma
by which many are drawn into their nurturant tutelage and/or grand schemes. Many
ENFJs have tremendous power to manipulate others with their phenomenal
interpersonal skills and unique salesmanship. But it's usually not meant as
manipulation -- ENFJs generally believe in their dreams, and see themselves as
helpers and enablers, which they usually are. 
<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs are global learners. They see the big picture. The ENFJs focus is
expansive. Some can juggle an amazing number of responsibilities or projects
simultaneously. Many ENFJs have tremendous entrepreneurial ability. 
<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs are, by definition, Js, with whom we associate organization and
decisiveness. But they don't resemble the SJs or even the NTJs in organization
of the environment nor occasional recalcitrance. ENFJs are organized in the
arena of interpersonal affairs. Their offices may or may not be cluttered, but
their conclusions (reached through feelings) about people and motives are drawn
much more quickly and are more resilient than those of their NFP counterparts.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs know and appreciate people. Like most NFs, (and Feelers in general), they
are apt to neglect themselves and their own needs for the needs of others. They
have thinner psychological boundaries than most, and are at risk for being hurt
or even abused by less sensitive people. ENFJs often take on more of the burdens
of others than they can bear.
<br/>
<br/>

TRADEMARK: "The first shall be last"
<br/>
<br/>

This refers to the open-door policy of ENFJs. One ENFJ colleague always welcomes
me into his office regardless of his own circumstances. If another person comes
to the door, he allows them to interrupt our conversation with their need. While
discussing that need, the phone rings and he stops to answer it. Others drop in
with a 'quick question.' I finally get up, go to my office and use the call
waiting feature on the telephone. When he hangs up, I have his undivided
attention!

Functional Analysis:
<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling
<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling rules the ENFJ's psyche. In the sway of this rational
function, these folks are predisposed to closure in matters pertaining to
people, and especially on behalf of their beloved. As extraverts, their contacts
are wide ranging. Face-to-face relationships are intense, personable and warm,
though they may be so infrequently achieved that intimate friendships are rare.
<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition
<br/>
<br/>

Like their INFJ cousins, ENFJs are blessed through introverted intuition with
clarity of perception in the inner, unconscious world. Dominant Feeling prefers
to find the silver lining in even the most beggarly perceptions of those in
their expanding circle of friends and, of course, in themselves. In less
balanced individuals, such mitigation of the unseemly eventually undermines the
ENFJ's integrity and frequently their good name. In healthier individuals, deft
use of this awareness of the inner needs and desires of others enables this
astute type to win friends, influence people, and avoid compromising
entanglements.
<br/>
<br/>

The dynamic nature of their intuition moves ENFJs from one project to another
with the assurance that the next one will be perfect, or much more nearly so
than the last. ENFJs are continually looking for newer and better solutions to
benefit their extensive family, staff, or organization.
<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Sensing
<br/>
<br/>

Sensing is extraverted. ENFJs can manage details, particularly those necessary
to implement the prevailing vision. These data have, however, a magical flexible
quality. Something to be bought can be had for a song; the same something is
invaluable when it's time to sell. (We are not certain, but we suspect that such
is the influence of the primary function.) This wavering of sensory perception
is made possible by the weaker and less mature status with which the tertiary is
endowed.
<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking
<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking is least apparent and most enigmatic in this type. In fact,
it often appears only when summoned by Feeling. At times only in jest, but in
earnest if need be, Thinking entertains as logical only those conclusions which
support Feeling's values. Other scenarios can be shown invalid or at best
significantly inferior. Such "Thinking in the service of Feeling" has the
appearance of logic, but somehow it never quite adds up.
<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking is frequently the focus of the spiritual quest of
ENFJs. David's lengthiest psalm, 119, pays it homage. "Law," "precept,"
"commandment," "statute:" these essences of inner thinking are the mysteries of
Deity for which this great Feeler's soul searched.

The Giver

<br/>
<br/>

As an ENFJ, you're primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal
with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your
personal value system. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in
primarily via your intuition.

<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs are people-focused individuals. They live in the world of people
possibilities. More so than any other type, they have excellent people
skills. They understand and care about people, and have a special talent for
bringing out the best in others. ENFJ's main interest in life is giving love,
support, and a good time to other people. They are focused on understanding,
supporting, and encouraging others. They make things happen for people, and get
their best personal satisfaction from this.

<br/>
<br/>

Because ENFJ's people skills are so extraordinary, they have the ability to make
people do exactly what they want them to do. They get under people's skins and
get the reactions that they are seeking. ENFJ's motives are usually unselfish,
but ENFJs who have developed less than ideally have been known to use their
power over people to manipulate them.

<br/>
<br/>

ENFJ's are so externally focused that it's especially important for them to
spend time alone. This can be difficult for some ENFJs, because they have the
tendency to be hard on themselves and turn to dark thoughts when
alone. Consequently, ENFJs might avoid being alone, and fill their lives with
activities involving other people. ENFJs tend to define their life's direction
and priorities according to other people's needs, and may not be aware of their
own needs. It's natural to their personality type that they will tend to place
other people's needs above their own, but they need to stay aware of their own
needs so that they don't sacrifice themselves in their drive to help others.

<br/>
<br/>

ENFJ's tend to be more reserved about exposing themselves than other extraverted
types. Although they may have strongly-felt beliefs, they're likely to refrain
from expressing them if doing so would interfere with bringing out the best in
others. Because their strongest interest lies in being a catalyst of change in
other people, they're likely to interact with others on their own level, in a
chameleon-like manner, rather than as individuals.

<br/>
<br/>

Which is not to say that the ENFJ does not have opinions. ENFJs have definite
values and opinions which they're able to express clearly and succinctly. These
beliefs will be expressed as long as they're not too personal. ENFJ is in many
ways expressive and open, but is more focused on being responsive and supportive
of others. When faced with a conflict between a strongly-held value and serving
another person's need, they are highly likely to value the other person's needs.

<br/>
<br/>

The ENFJ may feel quite lonely even when surrounded by people. This feeling of
aloneness may be exacerbated by the tendency to not reveal their true selves.

<br/>
<br/>

People love ENFJs. They are fun to be with, and truly understand and love
people. They are typically very straight-forward and honest. Usually ENFJs exude
a lot of self-confidence, and have a great amount of ability to do many
different things. They are generally bright, full of potential, energetic and
fast-paced. They are usually good at anything which captures their interest.

<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs like for things to be well-organized, and will work hard at maintaining
structure and resolving ambiguity. They have a tendency to be fussy, especially
with their home environments.

<br/>
<br/>

In the work place, ENFJs do well in positions where they deal with people. They
are naturals for the social committee. Their uncanny ability to understand
people and say just what needs to be said to make them happy makes them naturals
for counseling. They enjoy being the center of attention, and do very well in
situations where they can inspire and lead others, such as teaching.

<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs do not like dealing with impersonal reasoning. They don't understand or
appreciate its merit, and will be unhappy in situations where they're forced to
deal with logic and facts without any connection to a human element. Living in
the world of people possibilities, they enjoy their plans more than their
achievements. They get excited about possibilities for the future, but may
become easily bored and restless with the present.

<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs have a special gift with people, and are basically happy people when they
can use that gift to help others. They get their best satisfaction from serving
others. Their genuine interest in Humankind and their exceptional intuitive
awareness of people makes them able to draw out even the most reserved
individuals.

<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs have a strong need for close, intimate relationships, and will put forth a
lot of effort in creating and maintaining these relationships. They're very
loyal and trustworthy once involved in a relationship.

<br/>
<br/>

An ENFJ who has not developed their Feeling side may have difficulty making good
decisions, and may rely heavily on other people in decision-making processes. If
they have not developed their Intuition, they may not be able to see
possibilities, and will judge things too quickly based on established value
systems or social rules, without really understanding the current situation. An
ENFJ who has not found their place in the world is likely to be extremely
sensitive to criticism, and to have the tendency to worry excessively and feel
guilty. They are also likely to be very manipulative and controling with others.

<br/>
<br/>

In general, ENFJs are charming, warm, gracious, creative and diverse individuals
with richly developed insights into what makes other people tick. This special
ability to see growth potential in others combined with a genuine drive to help
people makes the ENFJ a truly valued individual. As giving and caring as the
ENFJ is, they need to remember to value their own needs as well as the needs of
others.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENFJ
<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ENFJs as Teachers, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Idealists.[2] ENFJs account for about 2-5% of the
population.


<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted feeling types seek continuity through harmonious relationships and
collective values. They excel at picking up on the tone of a situation and
acting accordingly, adding warmth to a cool setting or turning sour into
sweet. They naturally seek to know what people do well, what they enjoy, and
where and how they work. They seem to have an infinite number of acquaintances
from all walks of life and are always on the lookout for people in need and
those who can help out. ENFJs weave and strengthen the collective fabric of
social conventions and interactions. Inclusiveness is important and they are
particularly sensitive to those who are excluded. 

ENFJs focus on others, feeling a glow when those around them are happy, and
troubled when something is amiss. They are natural cheerleaders, often
expressing support, gratitude, and encouragement, and heaping praise onto those
they appreciate. They take note of what is being done and what needs doing,
offering their assistance wherever necessary. 


<br/>
<br/>

ENFJs enjoy organizing group activities and tend to take their commitments
seriously. In general, they are reliable and do not like to disappoint
others. As team players and project leaders, they have a gift for rallying their
players, focusing on what is being done right and each member's strengths. They
are loyal and they expect loyalty. They carry conversations well, finding common
ground with their speaker. They tend to find the correct and gracious way to
respond in any given situation, no matter how tense or uncomfortable it is. 


<br/>
<br/>

Types with dominant extraverted feeling may uphold a wide range of values,
simply because shared values are what create harmony. Some will profess the
importance of tough-minded logic, justice and scholarly debate because their
environments have these shared values. They tend to adopt the collective values
of those in their social group.
