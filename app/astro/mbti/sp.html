<h3>SP (Artisan)</h3>

Artisans, being concrete in communicating and utilitarian in implementing goals,
can become highly skilled in tactical variation. Thus their most practiced and
developed intelligent operations are usually promoting and operating (SPT
expediting), or displaying and composing (SPF improvizing). And they would if
they could be virtuosos of one of these forms artistic operation. Artisans are
proud of themselves in the degree they are graceful in action, respect
themselves in the degree they are daring, and feel confident of themselves in
the degree they are adaptable. This is the "Sensation Seeking
Personality"-trusting in spontaniety and hungering for impact on others. They
are usually hedonic about the present, optimistic about the future, cynical
about the past, and their preferred time and place is the here and
now. Educationally they go for arts and crafts, avocationally for techniques,
and vocationally for operations work. They tend to be permissive as parents,
playmates as spouses, and play oriented as children. There are many Artisans to
be found in many places where the action is, at least 35% and as many as 40% of
the population.
