<h3>ENTP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/entp.html

<br/>
<br/>

"Clever" is the word that perhaps describes ENTPs best. The professor who
juggles half a dozen ideas for research papers and grant proposals in his mind
while giving a highly entertaining lecture on an abstruse subject is a classic
example of the type. So is the stand-up comedian whose lampoons are both funny
and incisively accurate.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are usually verbally as well as cerebrally quick, and generally love to
argue--both for its own sake, and to show off their debating skills. ENTPs tend
to have a perverse sense of humor as well, and enjoy playing devil's
advocate. This sometimes confuses, even angers, those who don't understand or
accept the concept of argument as a sport.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are as innovative and ingenious at problem-solving as they are at verbal
gymnastics; on occasion, however, they manage to outsmart themselves. ENTPs can
be prone to "sharp practice" - especially cutting corners without regard to the
rules if it's expedient - or, their juggling acts may simply be so
over-ambitious they collapse.

<br/>
<br/>

Both at work and at home, ENTPs are very fond of "toys" -- physical or
intellectual, the more sophisticated the better. Once these have been "solved"
or become too familiar, however, they'll be replaced with new ones.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are basically optimists, but in spite of this (perhaps because of it?),
they can become petulant about small setbacks and inconveniences. (Major
setbacks they regard as challenges, and tackle with determination.) ENTPs have
little patience with those they consider wrongheaded or unintelligent, and show
little restraint in demonstrating this. In general, however, they are genial,
even charming, when not being harassed by life.

<br/>
<br/>

In terms of their relationships with others, ENTPs are capable of bonding very
closely and suddenly with their loved ones. Some appear deceptively offhand with
their nearest and dearest; others are so demonstrative that they succeed in
shocking co-workers who've only seen their professional side. ENTPs are also
quick to spot a kindred spirit, and good at acquiring friends of similar
temperament and interests.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs may sometimes give the impression of being largely oblivious to the rest
of humanity except as an audience: good, bad, or potential. In general this is
unfair - but it can be difficult to get an ENTP's attention when they're not
immediately aware of you, especially for an Introvert.

<br/>
<br/>

The best approach in communicating with an ENTP is to be straightforward. No
games - they'll win. No "pulling rank" - they'll just want to put you in your
place. No apologies - you'll undermine yourself. Try "I need/want to talk to
you."

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are nothing if not unique. Brave new associations flow freely from the
unconscious into the world of the living. Making, discovering and developing
connections between and among two or more of anything is virtually
automatic. The product of intuition is merely an icon of process; ENTPs are in
the business of change, improvement, experimentation.

<br/>
<br/>

The attraction Extraverted iNtuition has toward the real and physical amounts to
a cosmic non sequitur: theory is drawn to practice. Such encounters are clearly
puzzling. Both parties--the intuitor and the realist--are aware of a xenic
quality in their meeting, with reactions ranging from recoil to reverie.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

Thinking is iNtuition's ready assistant, an embodiment of the sort of logic
found in laws, boards and circuits. Thinking's job is to lend focus and
direction to iNtuition's critical mass. The temporary habitations of changeling
iNtuition are constructed of Boolean materials from Thinking's
storehouse. Ultimately, Thinking is no match for iNtuition's
prodigiousness. Systems lie in various states of disarray, fragmentary traces of
Thinking's feverish attempts to shadow and undergird the leaps of the dominant
function. One can only suppose that Thinking must continue to work during REM
sleep pulling together iNtuition's brainchildren into integral wholes.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

To the extent that Feeling is developed, ENTPs extravert Feeling judgment. As a
result, it is not uncommon to find affability and bonhomie in members of this
species. Tertiary functions are potentially utilitarian. Their limitations
appear in their relative underdevelopment, diminished endurance, and
vulnerability. ENTPs may harness Feeling's good will in areas such as sales,
service, drama, humor and art. ENTP loyalty often runs high and can be hooked by
those the ENTP counts as friends.

Introverted Sensing

Like a tail on the kite of iNtuition, Introverted Sensing counterweighs these
beings drawn to nonconformity and anarchy. These shadowy sensory forms, so
familiar to SJ types, serve as lodestones which many ENTPs employ Herculean
measures to escape. "Question authority! (then do exactly what it tells you)"
sums up the dilemma in which ENTPs may find themselves by attempting to best the
tarbaby Sensing. Occasionally acknowledging awareness of norms and abnormality
could, in theory, be potentially freeing.

<br/>
<br/>

Additionally, I've noticed that ENTPs have the need to have areas of
expertise/excellence/uniqueness in which one is second to none. I've never
beaten an ENTP at his/her own game--not in the final analysis. (e.g., just
tonight, my neighbor who is recuperating from an illness received a call from an
ENTP friend offering his special recipe for tea. The instructions required only
the finest ingredients, a particular brand of orange juice, tea made with a
ball--none of those horrid teabags--..., which will of course make the best tea
of which he himself drinks 50 gallons each winter!)

The Visionary
<br/>
<br/>


As an ENTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take
things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where
you deal with things rationally and logically.

<br/>
<br/>

With Extraverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's primary
interest in life is understanding the world that they live in. They are
constantly absorbing ideas and images about the situations they are presented in
their lives. Using their intuition to process this information, they are usually
extremely quick and accurate in their ability to size up a situation. With the
exception of their ENFP cousin, the ENTP has a deeper understanding of their
environment than any of the other types.

<br/>
<br/>

This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the ENTP at a
distinct advantage in their lives. They generally understand things quickly and
with great depth. Accordingly, they are quite flexible and adapt well to a wide
range of tasks. They are good at most anything that interests them. As they grow
and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they become very
aware of possibilities, and this makes them quite resourceful when solving
problems.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see
possibilities everywhere. They get excited and enthusiastic about their ideas,
and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way, they get the
support that they need to fulfill their visions.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are less interested in developing plans of actions or making decisions
than they are in generating possibilities and ideas. Following through on the
implementation of an idea is usually a chore to the ENTP. For some ENTPs, this
results in the habit of never finishing what they start. The ENTP who has not
developed their Thinking process will have problems with jumping
enthusiastically from idea to idea, without following through on their
plans. The ENTP needs to take care to think through their ideas fully in order
to take advantage of them.

<br/>
<br/>

The ENTP's auxiliary process of Introverted Thinking drives their decision
making process. Although the ENTP is more interested in absorbing information
than in making decisions, they are quite rational and logical in reaching
conclusions. When they apply Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the
outcome can be very powerful indeed. A well-developed ENTP is extremely
visionary, inventive, and enterprising.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal sparring
with others. They love to debate issues, and may even switch sides sometimes
just for the love of the debate. When they express their underlying principles,
however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely.

<br/>
<br/>

The ENTP personality type is sometimes referred to the "Lawyer" type. The ENTP
"lawyer" quickly and accurately understands a situation, and objectively and
logically acts upon the situation. Their Thinking side makes their actions and
decisions based on an objective list of rules or laws. If the ENTP was defending
someone who had actually committed a crime, they are likely to take advantage of
quirks in the law that will get their client off the hook. If they were to
actually win the case, they would see their actions as completely fair and
proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful. The guilt or
innocence of their client would not be as relevant. If this type of reasoning
goes uncompletely unchecked by the ENTP, it could result in a character that is
perceived by others as unethical or even dishonest. The ENTP, who does not
naturally consider the more personal or human element in decision making, should
take care to notice the subjective, personal side of situations. This is a
potential problem are for ENTPs. Although their logical abilities lend strength
and purpose to the ENTP, they may also isolate them from their feelings and from
other people.

<br/>
<br/>

The least developed area for the ENTP is the Sensing-Feeling arena. If the
Sensing areas are neglected, the ENTP may tend to not take care of details in
their life. If the Feeling part of themself is neglected, the ENTP may not value
other people's input enough, or may become overly harsh and aggressive.

<br/>
<br/>

Under stress, the ENTP may lose their ability to generate possibilities, and
become obsessed with minor details. These details may seem to be extremely
important to the ENTP, but in reality are usually not important to the big
picture.

<br/>
<br/>

In general, ENTPs are upbeat visionaries. They highly value knowledge, and spend
much of their lives seeking a higher understanding. They live in the world of
possibilities, and become excited about concepts, challenges and
difficulties. When presented with a problem, they're good at improvising and
quickly come up with a creative solution. Creative, clever, curious, and
theoretical, ENTPs have a broad range of possibilities in their lives.

<br/>
<br/>

Jungian functional preference ordering for ENTP:

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Extraverted Intuition
<br/>
Auxiliary: Introverted Thinking
<br/>
Tertiary: Extraverted Feeling
<br/>
Inferior: Introverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENTP

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ENTPs as Inventors, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Rationals. ENTPs account for about 2-5% of the
population.

<br/>
<br/>

* E - Extraversion preferred to introversion: ENTPs gain energy through
  interactions with people or objects in the outside world. They tend to enjoy
  having a wide circle of acquaintances.[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* N - Intuition preferred to sensing: ENTPs tend to be more abstract than
  concrete. They focus their attention on the big picture rather than the
  details, and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities.[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* T - Thinking preferred to feeling: ENTPs tend to value objective criteria
  above personal preference. When making decisions, they generally give more
  weight to logic than to social considerations.[8]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* P - Perception preferred to judgment: ENTPs tend to withhold judgment and
  delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should
  circumstances change.[9]
  
<br/>
<br/>

The ENTP has been described variously as the innovator,[12] the originator,[13]
the lawyer,[14] the inventor,[2] the explorer,[15] and the visionary.[14] ENTPs
also fall into the general categories of thinkers, rationals, and engineers.[16]

<br/>
<br/>

Myers-Briggs description

<br/>
<br/>

Using their primary function-attitude of extraverted intuition (Ne), ENTPs are
quick to see complex interrelationships between people, things, and ideas. These
interrelationships are analyzed in profound detail through the ENTPs auxiliary
function, introverted thinking (Ti). The result is an in-depth understanding of
the way things and relationships work, and how they can be improved. To the
ENTP, competence and intelligence are particularly prized, both in themselves
and in other people.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs are frequently described as clever, cerebrally and verbally quick,
enthusiastic, outgoing, innovative, flexible, loyal and resourceful. ENTPs are
motivated by a desire to understand and improve the world they live in. They are
usually accurate in sizing up a situation. They may have a perverse sense of
humor and sometimes play devil's advocate, which can create misunderstandings
with friends, coworkers, and family. ENTPs are ingenious and adept at directing
relationships between means and ends. ENTPs devise fresh, unexpected solutions
to difficult problems. However, they are less interested in generating and
following through with detailed plans than in generating ideas and
possibilities. In a team environment, ENTPs are most effective in a role where
they can draw on their abilities to offer deep understanding, a high degree of
flexibility, and innovative solutions to problems. The ENTP regards a comment
like "it can't be done" as a personal challenge, and, if properly motivated,
will spare no effort to discover a solution.

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey descriptions

<br/>
<br/>

Inventors are introspective, pragmatic, informative, and expressive. They can
become highly skilled in functional engineering and invention. Of all the role
variants, Inventors are the most resistant to doing things a certain way just
because it was done that way in the past. Intensely curious, Inventors are
always looking for new projects to work on, and they have an entrepreneurial
character. Designing and improving mechanisms and products is a constant goal of
Inventors.

<br/>
<br/>

Though full of ideas, Inventors are primarily interested in those that can be
put into action or used to make products. For example, they see product design
as a means to an end, the goal being a marketable prototype. When beginning a
project, they rarely start with a blueprint. Rather they are confident in their
ability to find effective and pragmatic solutions during the design process.

<br/>
<br/>

Inventors tend to be laid back, nonjudgmental, and good conversationalists. They
are often nonconformists who attract a circle of friends interested in their
ideas or activities. Generally informative rather than directive in their social
exchanges, Inventors are often able to explain their own complicated ideas well,
and to comprehend the complex ideas of others. In arguments they may use
debating skills, often to the significant disadvantage of their opponent.[2]
This strategy can backfire, however, by alienating those seeking a cooperative
relationship rather than a combative one.[17]

<br/>
<br/>

Inventors are usually ingenious individuals who are capable of rising to meet the demands of challenging situations. In work, they tend to be good leaders of pilot products that test their abilities. Constantly looking for new ways to do things, Inventors usually have the drive and the social skills to implement their ideas.[2]

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functions (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) form a
hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's so-called default pattern of
behavior.

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information gathering
function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making function
(thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less developed
than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding out the
person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's Achilles'
heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the Tertiary,
the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[18]

<br/>
<br/>

Jung and Myers considered the attitude of the Auxiliary, Tertiary, and Inferior
functions to be the opposite of the Dominant. In this interpretation, if the
Dominant function is extraverted, then the other three are introverted, and vice
versa. However, many modern practitioners hold that the attitude of the Tertiary
function is the same as the Dominant.[5] Using the more modern interpretation,
the cognitive functions of the ENTP are as follows:[18]

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Extraverted intuition (Ne)

<br/>
<br/>

Ne finds and interprets hidden meanings. This intuitive play weaves together
insights and experiences from various sources to find the whole, which can then
become a catalyst to action.[19] Ne allows the ENTP to effortlessly identify
complex interrelationships between ideas, people, and things that are often
invisible to most other personality types.[20]

<br/>
<br/>

Auxiliary: Introverted thinking (Ti)

<br/>
<br/>

Ti seeks precision, such as the exact word to express an idea. It notices the
minute distinctions that define the essence of things, then analyzes and
classifies them. Ti examines all sides of an issue, looking to solve problems
while minimizing effort and risk. It uses models to root out logical
inconsistency.[21] In the ENTP, Ti analyzes the constant stream of information
that Ne provides. Ti develops structure and reconciles any inconsistencies in
the ENTP's belief system. However, Ti cannot match the activity of Ne, which
leads the ENTP to juggle multiple projects and theoretical enterprises at any
given time, in various stages of completion.[20]

<br/>
<br/>

Tertiary: Extraverted feeling (Fe)

<br/>
<br/>

Fe seeks social connections and creates harmonious interactions through polite,
considerate, and appropriate behavior. Fe responds to the explicit (and
implicit) wants of others, and may even create an internal conflict between the
subject's own needs and the desire to meet the needs of others.[22] When Fe is
well developed, the ENTP can foster goodwill in others, and can be seen as quite
charming and loyal. When it is not well developed, the ENTP can be seen as aloof
and unconcerned with other people's feelings. In most ENTPs, weakness of the
tertiary function can be observed in its inconsistency or lack of endurance.[20]

<br/>
<br/>

Inferior: Introverted sensing (Si)

<br/>
<br/>

Si collects data in the present moment and compares it with past experiences, a
process that sometimes evokes the feelings associated with memory, as if the
subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect what is familiar, Si draws upon
history to form goals and expectations about what will happen in the future.[23]
Si offsets the ENTP's natural tendency toward anarchy and non-conformity. It
acts as a sort of gravitational pull that keeps the ENTP in orbit around
reality. Without this function, the ENTP can be seen as unpredictable and
random, but when it is well developed, the ENTP is seen as orderly and
understandable.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs direct their energy towards the outer world of actions and
spoken words. They try to create new potential, changing things to see
if any improvement can be made, and generally working towards a better
future. They are often trying challenging the status quo and
instigating change. 

<br/>
<br/>
What makes an ENTP tick?

<br/>
<br/>
The Dominant function is the perceptive one of
iNtuition. Characteristics associated with this function include:  

<br/>
<br/>

Likes looking at information from a global viewpoint, spotting
patterns and relationships, that lead to an understanding of the key
issues 

<br/>
<br/>

Focuses more on possibilities for the future than the here-and-now

<br/>
Enjoys change, challenge, and variety 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP Mental Muscle Diagram

<br/>
<br/>
The perceptive iNtuition function is extraverted. That is, iNtuition
is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken
words. The ENTP will therefore: 

<br/>
<br/>
Try ideas out, to explore new possibilities and discover, by
experience, which ones work 
<br/>
Change procedures to see if any improvement can be made, rather than
just operate them 
<br/>
Be interested primarily in evolutionary development, perhaps with an
eye on the strategy. 
<br/>
Be more interested in exploring ideas than bringing them to closure 

<br/>
<br/>
The iNtuition function is primarily supported by introverted Thinking
judgement. That is, Thinking judgement is used primarily to manage the
inner world of thoughts and emotions. This will modify the way that
the iNtuition is directed, by: 

<br/>
<br/>
focusing the (outer world) iNtuition on ideas and possibilities that relate to systems and concepts
inwardly tending to spot the flaws in situations, people or ideas. Rather than expressing criticism directly, it may surface in the form of contradictory ideas and possibilities.
applying logical analysis to perceived patterns and possibilities, enabling the ENTP to quickly see the underlying principles in a situation 

<br/>
<br/>
The classic temperament of an ENTP is Promethean, or Phlegmatic, for
whom a basic driving force is the search for competence or
excellence. 
<br/>
<br/>
Contributions to the team of an ENTP

<br/>
<br/>
In a team environment, the ENTP can contribute by:

<br/>
<br/>
challenging the status quo, and encouraging other team members to
achieve more than they thought they could 
<br/>
leading other team members to a greater understanding of the concepts and principles involved
<br/>
involving people who are competent in relevant skills
<br/>
contributing creative ideas on how the task can be achieved or quality improved
<br/>
creating new ideas out of confrontational discussion
<br/>
finding ways to overcome apparently insurmountable difficulties
<br/>
generating team spirit though the ENTP's own energy and enthusiasm 

<br/>
<br/>
The potential ways in which an ENTP can irritate others include:

<br/>
<br/>
initiating too many projects, and not being able to deliver on all of them
<br/>
introducing too much change, and not leaving well-established, workable routines alone
<br/>
not taking sufficient account of current realities
<br/>
appearing competitive and unappreciative of the contribution of others
<br/>
leaving someone else to do the routine work
<br/>
making errors of fact 

<br/>
<br/>
Personal Growth
<br/>
<br/>
As with all types, the ENTP can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as:

<br/>
<br/>
being selective about the initiation of projects
pausing and thinking, and recognising that others will accept the ENTP
and his/her ideas more if their own contributions are accepted and
valued 
<br/>
appreciating the value of existing routines that work well
<br/>
investigating the facts, and documenting them, before interpreting what they mean
<br/>
taking time to consider the impact of the ENTP's approach and ideas on people's feelings
<br/>
expressing appreciation towards others 

<br/>
<br/>
Recognising Stress

<br/>
<br/>
In a crisis, the ENTP might: 

<br/>
<br/>
spend time brainstorming ideas, and debating or critiquing what needs to be done
<br/>
provide a lot of drive, but try to do too much
<br/>
draft in people with proven skills to work on the problem
<br/>
make errors of fact, or ignore routine matters that might nevertheless be essential 

<br/>
<br/>
Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the ENTP's shadow may appear
- a negative form of ISFJ. Example characteristics are: 

<br/>
<br/>
being pedantic about unimportant details doing things to excess -
<br/>
e.g.: eating, drinking or exercising expressing emotions in an
<br/>
intensive and uncontrolled way being very sensitive to criticism

<br/>
<br/>
http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENTP_rel.html

<br/>
<br/>

Typically good-natured, upbeat and laid-back, ENTPs can be delightful
people to be around. They get a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction from
interacting with others, and especially enjoy discussing and debating
theories and concepts which interest them. They may be prone to
initiate arguments because they so enjoy the debate. They are
generally fun-loving and gregarious, and can be quite charming. They
have a problem with sometimes neglecting their close relationships
when they become involved in the pursuit of a new idea or plan. 

<br/>
<br/>

ENTP Weaknesses

<br/>
<br/>
Always excited by anything new, they may change partners frequently
<br/>
Tendency to not follow through on their plans and ideas
<br/>
Their love of debate may cause them to provoke arguments
<br/>
Big risk-takers and big spenders, not usually good at managing money
<br/>
Although they take their commitments seriously, they tend to
abandon their relationships which no longer offer opportunity for
growth 
    
<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs as Lovers

<br/>
<br/>
"To love means to open ourselves to the negative as well as the
positive - to grief, sorrow, and disappointment as well as to joy,
fulfillment, and an intensity of consciousness we did not know was
possible before." -- Rollo May 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's goals for their intimate relationships are similar to their
other personal goals: improvement and growth. They constantly ask
themselves questions such as: How can the relationship be improved?
Where is the relationship headed? Am I growing in the relationship?
They are likely to enthusiastically embrace new ideas and projects for
themselves and their mates which they feel will propel them along
their goal for growth and knowledge discovery. The ENTP's general
enthusiasiam and good intentions are usually quite positive and
healthful in a relationship.      

<br/>
<br/>
A problem area for ENTP's is their tendency to not follow through on
their schemes. This can be frustrating to their mates. It may also
create a "boy who called wolf" syndrome in their relationships, with
their partner never believing that the ENTP will actually do what they
say they'll do. 

<br/>
<br/>
Another potential problem area is the ENTP's general tendency towards
"wildness" and willingness to take risks. They may lead the family
into uncomfortable financial situations, which can be quite stressful
on intimate relationships. 

<br/>
<br/>
Sexually, the ENTP is enthusiastic and interested in positive,
constant growth for both partners. They're likely to be very
attentive, involved, and questioning. They enjoy spontaneity rather
than fixed schedules, and fully embrace new ideas and
adventures. They're likely to approach intimacy as more of a physical
act which conveys affection, rather than as an opportunity to
explicitly express affection. 

<br/>
<br/>
In general, ENTP's childlike enthusiasm and genuine interest in the
health and direction of the relationship makes them willing and able
to promote healthy, growing relationships with their significant
others. They need to watch out for their tendency to be unaware of
what others are feeling, and to inadvertantly neglect their
relationships when faced with exciting possibilities that are external
to their personal life. 

<br/>
<br/>
Although two well-developed individuals of any type can enjoy a
healthy relationship, ENTP's natural partner is the INFJ, or the
INTJ. The ENTP's dominant function of Extraverted Intuition is best
matched with a personality that is dominated by Introverted
Intuition. How did we arrive at this?

<br/>
<br/>
Explorer Inventor: ENTP

<br/>
<br/>
Relationship

<br/>
<br/>
The ENTP is all about enthusiasm. The ENTP also has the problem of not
always following through on the ideas they will so enthusiastically
promote. They believe that almost anything can be made better. This is
not always easy for friends to deal with. 

<br/>
<br/>
In love relationships the ENTP one can expect to be challenged,
usually by anything that may come along. This is usually good and bad,
interesting but also irritating. The ENTP will usually be at the
center and view themselves that way. 

<br/>
<br/>
The ENTP enjoys the family since it is another opportunity to exchange
ideas. Though not always a consistent behaving member of the family,
they like to show and engage in discussion.

<br/>
<br/>
Career

<br/>
<br/>
Work that allows the ENTP to be challenged and stimulated will be
highly attractive. Work that binds an ENTP to standard operating
procedures will be ultimately frustrating and stress
inducing. Computer Science, financial advising and teaching are all
endeavors that may be attractive to the ENTP. Other popular ENTP
career directions include: Systems Designer, Actor, Real Estate Agent,
Politician and Computer Analyst. 

<br/>
<br/>
Education

<br/>
<br/> 
The ENTP would much rather learn by getting involved than by being
lectured to. In true entrepreneurial spirit, if their involvement
results in something that can be used shared or marketed, so much the
better.

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's wish to exercise their ingenuity in the world of people and
things. Found in about five out of every hundred people, ENTP's
extravert intuition; thus they deal imaginatively with social
relationships as well as physical and mechanical relations. They are
very alert to what is apt to occur next, and always sensitive to
possibilities.   

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's are good at analysis, especially functional analysis, and have
both a tolerance for and enjoyment of the complex. Usually
enthusiastic, ENTP's are apt to express interest in everything, and
thus are a source of inspiration to others, who find themselves caught
up by the ENTP's enthusiasm. This type is delighted over many things
and so is easy to please, often showing the effervescence of their NF
counterpart, the ENFP. The ENTP is the most reluctant of all the types
to do things in a particular manner just because that is the way
things always have been done. They characteristically have an eye out
for a better way, always on the lookout for new projects, new
activities, and new procedures.

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's are confident in the value of their pursuits and display a
charming capacity to ignore the standard, the traditional and the
authoritative. As a result of this open attitude, they often bring a
fresh, new approach to their work and their lives. The ENTP is a keen
judge of the pragmatics of both the social and the mechanical, and may
become expert at directing relationships between means and ends. 

<br/>
<br/>
Where the introverted NTP sees design as an end in itself, the
extraverted NTP sees design as a means; the end is the invention that
works, the prototype that is replicable. Ideas are valuable when and
only when they make possible actions and objects. "It can't be done"
is a challenge to an ENTP and elicits a reaction of "I can do it."
They are not, however, the movers of mountains as are the
INTJ's. Rather, the faith of the ENTP's is in their ability to
improvise something, and they display and unusual talent for rising to
the expediency of a situation. Superficially, ENTP's resemble ESTP's
in their derringdo. But the focus of the ENTP is on the competency and
the sense of power this gives, rather than on the feeling of freedom
of action experienced by the ESTP.

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's can be fascinating conversationalists, able as they are to
follow the complex verbalizations of others. They may deliberately
employ debate tactics to the disadvantage of their opponents, even
when the "opponents" are close associates and valued friends. ENTP's
are the most able of all types to maintain a one-up position with
others. They value adaptability and innovation and thus respond
quickly and adeptly to another's shifting position. They may even be
several jumps ahead. The ENTP, talkative and motivating, is often the
life of an enterprise. The ENTP can be an entrepreneur and cleverly
makes do with whatever or whoever is at hand, counting on ingenuity to
solve problems as they arise, rather than carefully generating a
detailed blueprint in advance. A rough draft is all that an ENTP needs
to feel confident and ready to proceed into action, counting on the
ability to improvise as a situation develops. Because of this tendency
to depend on ingenuity and improvision, they may neglect very
necessary preparation at times. After repeated failures in situations
where improvising has met with defeat, the ENTP may develop ways of
avoiding such situations as a substitute to thorough preparation.

<br/>
<br/>
Career

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's can succeed in a variety of occupations, as long as the job
does not involve too much humdrum routine. At this point, they become
restless. If a project, in which they are engaged is no longer
challenging, they tend to lose interest in that project and fail to
follow through - often to the discomfort of colleagues.

<br/>
<br/>
Seldom are ENTP's conformists. ENTP's enjoy outwitting the system and
use rules and regulations within the system to win the game - whatever
it may be. The understand well the politics of institutions and deal
with these realities very well, always aiming to understand the people
within the system rather than to judge them. ENTP's are good at
innovative projects and can administer them well if well routine is
not involved. They usually are outstanding teachers, continuously
devising new participative ways to make learning exciting for the
students. As an employee, an ENTP may work against the system just for
the joy of being one-up. For ENTP's, to be taken-in, to be manipulated
by another is humiliating; this offends their joy in being masters of
the art of one-upmanship. ENTP's are the natural engineers of human
relationships and human systems. Their good humor and optimistic
outlook tend to be contagious, and people seek out their company.

<br/>
<br/>
As mates, ENTP's tend to create a lively living environment. They are
gregarious, laugh easily and often, and are typically in good
humor. Orderliness in the routines of daily living is not apt to
inspire them; they usually solve this problem by mobilizing those
around them. Tom Sawyer illustrated this talent when he solved the
problem of getting Aunt Polly's fence whitewashed. Life with ENTP's is
likely to be a daring adventure; they can lead families to physical
and economic dangers. ENTP's improvise to remain unaware that they do
not have the necessary knowledge of the situation to ward off such
dangers.

<br/>
<br/>
Home

<br/>
<br/>
If the mate of an ENTP is not competitive, he or she is likely to find
one-up/one-down transactions somewhat wearing. If the mate is
competitive, the result might be conflict. Although usually good
providers of economic necessities, ENTP's at times engage in
brinkmanship with their careers, placing them in jeopardy and behaving
as if unaware of the consequences; they may thus offer unnecessary
challenges to those who have power over their professional
success. When challenges elicit negative responses from superiors,
ENTP's are apt to react with delight at having an opportunity to
improvise a solution to the crisis and, more often than not, they
succeed in doing so.

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's are likely to have all sorts of hobbies and to be experts in
unexpected areas, but they are not apt to share these hobbies with
their mates or children in the sense of teaching them. In fact, ENTP's
may be very inconsistent in the attention given to offspring. Usually,
it is feast or famine. ENTP's have a lively circle of friends and are
seldom critical or nagging. At their worst, they can show
undependable, fickle characteristics and may be rather easily
discouraged.

<br/>
<br/>
Midlife

<br/>
<br/>
At midlife ENTP's can allow their tendency to experiment recklessly to
get out of hand and may destroy or discard the work of half a
lifetime, both in personal relationships and in careers. Energy spent
in sorting out priorities and values may be a good investment at this
time. Developing an increased awareness of emotional reactions and
expanding the intensity and range of these through self-development
work may be something ENTP's might want to consider at midlife. An
increased repertoire of introverted-type activities; for example,
gardening, painting, or reading may be a source of pleasure to ENTP's.

<br/>
<br/>
Mates

<br/>
<br/>
The inventive ENTP finds in the ISFJ a neat complementarity for his
enterprise, for in the ISFJ he finds the supreme conservator. The
conservator, broadly conceived, is morally bound to ensure the
material and legal welfare of his or her charge. The inventor, also
broadly conceived, is bent on replacing whatever tools, operation, or
enterprise now exists with a better one. Out to exercise his
ingenuity in bettering things, the ENTP is of necessity iconoclastic
and tends to be so seen. So he can get into a bit of trouble with the
elders, who usually are not all that pleased to see their tried-and
true tools, operations, and enterprises blithely set aside for the
ENTP's better mousetrap. The ISFJ, mated to this inventive rascal,
takes on the task of squaring things with the establishment.

<br/>
<br/>
The ENTP also may be attracted to his opposite on the N side: he
approaches the INFJ. But the INFJ is humorously and preposterously
different from the seemingly similar ISFJ. In the INFJ lies the soul
of the "author" - the meaning-giver, the mystic, the oracle. Perhaps
the INFJ is a conservator of the soul, a sort of messiah. At any rate,
there is something about the "author" (very broadly conceived) which
the ENTP covets. Prometheus had to pay dearly for giving fire to
man. The Promethean ENTP may figure that, though his INFJ mate may not
rescue his body from the vultures, at least the INFJ might rescue his
souls from Hell.

<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs are energetic individuals who pursue their interests with great
drive and enthusiasm. As they like to share their enthusiasms with
others, ENTPs are often perceived as inspirational and can be good at
motivating those around them. 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs abhor routine and get bored very easily. They value spontaneity,
variety and room for manoeuvre. As a result ENTPs are usually
unconventional. They can spend their lives in one career but it is
more common for them to move from one interesting project or
organisation to another. They are often high risk-takers and
entrepreneurial by nature. 

<br/>
<br/>
Their unconventional approach together with their energy and
enthusiasm means ENTPs can be stimulating company. They generally have
a strong sense of humour and pepper their conversation with puns and
word play. 

<br/>
<br/>
An ENTP's favourite, or dominant, function is intuition which they
prefer to use in the extravert world. In effect, this means ENTPs love
talking about meaning or possibilities for innovative projects. They
spend much of their time telling other people about their pet theories
on life, sharing their observations about what is really going on or
engaging others in discussions about "why" such as such is the case. 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs generally dislike small talk and will either try to get the
conversation on to more meaningful topics or they will go off and find
someone more interesting to talk to. ENTPs often enjoy  playing
devil's advocate or will even argue both sides of an argument
simultaneously. Some of the 16 types find it difficult to get on with
other people of the same type, but generally ENTPs find each other
attractive and stimulating company.  

<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs have a preference for using thinking in their interior world. It
is when they retreat into themselves that they evaluate, form
opinions, make decisions and plan various courses of action. ENTPs
often use writing as a way to bring discipline and structure to their
ideas. A paradox for ENTPs is that while their outer life can be messy
and unstructured, their inner life is orderly and governed by logic. 

<br/>
<br/>
Many ENTPs see life as a puzzle to solve. Their role is understanding
what is really going on and then improving on it in some way. ENTPs
are not content with small changes, however, and are usually
self-confident and ambitious innovators. 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs frequently see themselves as part of what they may need to
change. Of all the 16 types, it is ENTPs who see themselves, not as
fixed entities, but as individuals with skills, experiences and
attitudes which are constantly changing, adapting and improving in
line with the needs of the moment 

<br/>
<br/>
This view of themselves and general approach to life leads most ENTPs
to describe themselves as "clever". Another word ENTPs frequently
choose to describe themselves is "challenging". This they see as a
positive characteristic and simply means they are not prepared to
accept anything for the sake of a quiet life. These tendencies are
much more prevalent in male ENTPs and women's conditioning usually
leads female ENTPs to tone down this side of their personality. 

<br/>
<br/>
It is precisely the kind of things that ENTPs like about themselves
that other types often find irritating. Their need to display their
cleverness in the external world can be seen as a desire to show
off. Their verbal challenges are often interpreted by others as one
upmanship and their conversational style can come over as
confrontational and "bolshie". ENTPs have been known to describe
themselves as "interesting but tiring and hard work".  

<br/>
<br/>
All Ps struggle with organisation and maintaining order but ENTPs find
it particularly hard. Their brain is so preoccupied with abstract
ideas and possibilities that order and practical arrangements are a
major challenge. Unless, the ENTP has trained him/herself to be
methodical in their daily practices, it is not uncommon for ENTPs to
feel their life might suddenly spin out of control.  They know
intuitively that their scant attention to whether car lights have been
turned off, or where keys and tickets have been placed could at any
moment become a major challenge for them. Most ENTPs as they get older
become so aware of their potential weakness in this area that they
become frequent (and irrational) checkers of tickets, money, passports
etc.  

<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately success in life for ENTPs depends on using their
introverted thinking to keep their intuition within useful bounds. It
is crucially important for ENTPs to learn to resist squandering their
energy by pursuing too many different things. They must use their
thinking to discriminate better between an interesting idea and
something which is worthwhile pursuing. They must also cultivate
enough J skills for their projects to bear fruit. 

<br/>
<br/>
http://www.personalitynation.com/entp/5085-my-very-own-entp-description.html

<br/>
<br/>
Clever, curious, funny and a meanderingly obsessive, ENTP's are like a
disheveled mad scientist who actually took time to be social and
charming, although not entirely mindful of things refined or polite. 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's have a range of interests (or shall we say "obsessions"?) that
span like small, personal "quests completed" throughout the ENTP's
past. It is as if they have "Oo Shiny!" moments, but those moments are
intellectual pursuits and last longer. ENTP's have a unique ability to
make connections with almost any two items or topics. Consequently,
ENTP's obsessions can often be very random. When it does happen
though, many ENTP's will become so engrossed in a particular subject,
that they will skip multiple meals and chase that topic well into the
night, making food, sleep and basic life functions a mere afterthought
in the wake of their discovery or completion of a particular item of
interest. One might conclude that the ENTP would waste countless hours
studying a random topic, but to the ENTP, that random topic is more
important than anything that might be going on around them at the
time. Surprisingly, even when homework, friends, and relationships are
put on the back burner in place of the "newest, shiniest intellectual
toy", the ENTP seems to be very skillful at recovering what was
neglected, once the ENTP's "challenge" has been completed. 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's are master's at coming up with multiple possibilities at
once. Their thoughts explore every angle, through and through, while
seeming to carry on only one viewpoint in a
conversation. Consequently, ENTP's are very skilled at arguing, since
they are exploring every facet of the topic and may be several steps
ahead of their opponent. When debating, any input of knowledge is
considered and weighed, although a less developed ENTP might ignore
this if they consider the debate a challenge to be won, rather than a
challenge to be right. In such case, the ENTP will sometimes toy with
their opponent, walking them into logical traps for their own
amusement. If that opponent is able to hold their own however, and
even if that opponent somehow manages to win, the ENTP won't take it
personally. In fact, the ENTP will most likely respect that other
person and may even hold them in higher esteem. 

<br/>
<br/>
Socially, the ENTP views much in a formula fashion. They walk a
balance between being socially spontaneous, and socially rehearsed. On
one hand, they will use their quick exploration into every angle of
conversation to answer back with creative, witty and often humorous
responses, and the other hand, they might implore social strategies
the ENTP may have analyzed and concocted beforehand. 

<br/>
<br/>
ENTP's are constantly studying their audience to see what kind of
response they return. Depending on the response, the ENTP will analyze
and tailor his or her approach, making the ENTP very adaptable. This
can lead to some inner conflict then, where the ENTP seems overly
confident in their abilities, and yet insecure in how others might
picture them. Additionally, ENTP's view everything objectively. With
little inner emotional or subjective responses to things then, very
little offends or makes them awkward. Consequently, they may find it
amusing to offend, or make others uncomfortable. This creates a second
inner conflict, as the ENTP might value how others picture them
overall, and at the same time lightheartedly be prone to offend or
make others uncomfortable.  

<br/>
<br/>
To an ENTP, it's much better to be admired than in control. They have
little desire to lord their ideas over others, and have a suspension
dynamic when under a leader. That suspension lies in the fact that the
ENTP doesn't seem to have a problem going with the flow of the
leadership as long as it's heading the direction the ENTP wishes to
go, but ENTP's have proven to be very able leaders when called upon
and furthermore, have no problem (and a mischievous knack for)
"stealing" the leadership role from a leader he disagrees with. Or, if
that is proven to be impossible; they will break out from under the
leadership position, usually getting others to follow. 

<br/>
<br/>
Optimism resonates with the ENTP. The idea of tackling the impossible
is appealing to the ENTP, and hence will make the ENTP wish to be the
first, or best at doing something. They will use this mindset then, to
try and invent or figure out things that have never been done or
thought of. Because of this optimism, many ENTP's will be under the
impression that they can do ANYTHING if given enough time and effort
and will thus be prone to coming off narcissistic or
critical. Narcissistic because they think they are or will be better
at something than anyone else, and critical because they are less
likely to be impressed by something they believe they are capable of,
if given enough time and effort. Combining optimism with a constant
view of what could be, minor setbacks are seen as taking the steam out
of the ENTP's adrenaline pumped ambition and be viewed with annoyance
by the ENTP. Additionally, the ENTP is usually fully aware of what may
stand in the way of his obstacle and may become irritated by those
pointing out the negative, especially when it's obvious. 

<br/>
<br/>
Although an ENTP's focus is turned outward and to his environment, it
isn't as much in a mindset of relating to people, as it is studying
and analyzing them. Like any human being, connecting with people is
important, but the ENTP's extroverted nature doesn't seem to stem from
connecting, but rather from being in a setting where almost endless
possibilities and endless social rabbit holes await to fill their
curious nature. People can be regarded by the ENTP as one more
personal challenge. Can I get this group to like me? Can I figure this
person out, and once I do, will I be able to influence them or get
them to admire me? If not, the ENTP can become frustrated and "fall
back to regroup" and try again. This might translate as the need to be
liked, but it would be more appropriately looked at as a social
challenge that the ENTP incessantly tries to win, and once completed,
can be replaced with another if the ENTP isn't well developed. In
summary, a tendency of an ENTP is that he will skillfully work for
your admiration, but after the ENTP has it, he is not nearly as
concerned to lose it. 

<br/>
<br/>
It is not uncommon for an ENTP to retreat after a social setting, not
because he feels drained, but because he feels energized by all of the
new interactions and must take time to analyze and process all of the
"data received". ENTP's are able to replay scenarios in their head and
imagine what might have happened that could have improved the
situation, to be logged away for use at another similar
setting. Because of the optimism combined with this, ENTP's have been
known to be able to spend hours in their head, creating ideal
situations and conversations out of a situation that may have gone
wrong or not ideal. 

<br/>
<br/>
If an ENTP is able to have his curiosity filled by something
inanimate, he would feel no obligation or need to socialize. For
instance, if computer programming happens to be on the mind of an
ENTP, he could lock himself away for days figuring it out before he is
too tired of being shut out from the world. An ENTP may even retreat
into his own head IN a social setting if the social setting has no
room for fascination or curiosity. It is because of all of this that
most ENTP's and friends of ENTP's would be on the fence as to whether
or not the ENTP is introverted or extroverted, as they can appear to
be both. 

<br/>
<br/>
Although the ENTP often has trouble keeping his immediate surroundings
organized, this isn't due to inability, as much as it is simply a
focus on other things the ENTP will regard as far more
important. Clutter on a desk is more a result of paying no attention
to the aspects of his world that aren't directly related to his latest
obsession. When it comes to his obsession however, things may very
well be in order. For instance, an ENTP's computer may have every file
neatly placed in it's corresponding folders and every song title in
the library may be categorized and fully tagged, while his room/car
etc might be in chaos. Cleaning the car might distract and waste too
much time. Time he would be spending figuring out a computer
programming language for instance. Once the ENTP finally does put
focus on organization, many times he becomes obsessive about that as
well, making every part of his room spotless, just to be neglected
soon after the challenge is complete. 

<br/>
<br/>
Romantically, ENTP's are looking for an ideal mate. Their optimistic
mentality of "shoot for the stars", combined with their restless soul
and constant need for a challenge makes the ENTP slow to settle
down. An ENTP might be constantly believing there are better things,
right around the corner and consequently, may have had many "perfect
options" that he let get away. These might haunt an ENTP, but still
wouldn't slow him down much. An ENTP will settle down once he finds
someone who he feels with meet the strict criteria, or steal his heart
faster than he could complain. 

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
ENTPs are highly dynamic individuals who typically say, "If at first
you do not succeed, try whatever is next or just move on." You are
happiest living on the edge of the future.  For you, life is one
delightful game. 

<br/>
<br/>
You function continually in the realm of the possible and when
absorbed in your latest project, you can think of little else.  With
an energy level sometimes exhausting to behold, you are virtually
tireless in the pursuit of your latest goal- as long as your interest
in the project holds. 

<br/>
<br/>
You are a devoted explorer of a world where peering through the mists
of the far horizon is your primary interest.  In your quest for new
ideas, adventures, and absorbing projects, you continually learn that
your goal loses its attractiveness after you solve the major
challenges and problems, or as soon as it degenerates into a
predictable routine.  When the end is in sight and your interest
wanes, it can be difficult for you to muster enough self-discipline to
see the task through to completion. 

<br/>
<br/>
You are a terrific initiator who often artfully hands over
half-completed projects to a "detail oriented" colleague or associate
to finish.  But the dedication and self-confidence you exhibit are
infectious and therefore you tend to have devoted followers.  You have
the ability to be a guru for those who lack your talent, perseverance
and personal drive- you are well suited to lead. 

<br/>
<br/>
You tackle an amazing variety of problems with ease; the breadth of
your interests is your strong point.  Being able to exercise this
variety, flexibility and versatility in your nature is the primary key
to happiness in your life. 

<br/>
<br/>
As a Thinker, you are an independent character, who can feel good
about yourself with or without approval from others.  Many individuals
with your personality style enjoy a role as a renegade.  Even though
you are probably your own best critic, it will be very valuable to
solicit and listen to the opinions of others whom you respect before
high-tailing it off to your next all-absorbing project.  People
contain tons of useful information, even though you may find it
difficult to find others who can keep up with your quick mind and
rapid-fire ideas. 

<br/>
<br/>
When you are not actively recruiting followers to work on your latest
cause, or when you are being consumed by your current interest, your
impersonal attitude toward people and short attention span in human
relationships can make you appear outwardly cool and distant.  You
value logic over sentiment and it is sometimes impossible for you to
appreciate how others value emotion.  You do, however, have the
necessary personal and communication skills to connect with people
when you want.  Even though you might not employ them often enough,
you do know the value of eye contact, body language, a little
recognition and a fond personal address when speaking with someone. 

<br/>
<br/>
In the working world, you will find that your Extraversion is an asset
when dealing with both variety and action.  In tasks requiring quick
decisions and fast action, you reign supreme.  However, you must
constantly be on guard not to act too quickly, particularly without
thinking things through completely before you dive into action.  If
the nature of the work itself is slow, or if it involves long term
projects, you may need to devise a few tricks to ward off boredom.
Otherwise, your efficiency may suffer. 

<br/>
<br/>
You may have already found it to be helpful to surround yourself with
a few "practical types"- people who look at things with their Sensory
capacity.  While you may find this difficult- since Intuitive people
usually prefer the company of other, like-minded souls- you will
probably find their counsel valuable.  An Intuiting person with a
Sensory type partner may achieve more than the Intuitive alone, since
facts and details will not be overlooked along the way. 

<br/>
<br/>
You are an Intuiting person, who scans the horizon searching out the
possibilities in a situation, rather than staring down at the
pavement.  This quality prepares you well to be an inventor, explorer
and visionary.  Your interest lies in new ideas and theories and you
bring together a great deal of energy, patience and fortitude when
digging in to solve new problems. 

<br/>
<br/>
Your Perceiving side is open to changing situations.  In fact, you may
even enjoy tasks requiring repeated revisions.  Diversity at work is
enjoyable and you have no trouble shifting gears from one assignment
to another.  On the other hand, your Perceiving nature may instigate
too many changes without being asked, revising when unnecessary.  If
you are not careful, many of those self-started activities could wind
up in a desk drawer, first postponed, then forgotten. 

<br/>
<br/>
Your inner world is one of thought, analysis and concentration.  You
are a Thinker, with your mind constantly going like a busy computer.
In love with learning, fascinated by the very concept of intelligence,
your Type seems to have an inner drive toward performance and a highly
self-critical nature that continually drives you toward
self-improvement.  You are able to develop considerable detachment
from your own work and to subject it to the same scrutiny you apply to
all intellectual matters. 

<br/>
<br/>
You are also supremely self-confident and your intellectual ability
provides the substance you need to accomplish virtually anything you
wish in life. Periodically, however, you are plagued by the recurring
thought that you are somehow on the brink of failure and that you
might not achieve your personal goal this time.  You are a tough
taskmaster and critic of yourself.  You need to learn to give yourself
a break. 

<br/>
<br/>
Your outgoing personality prefers working with human companionship.
You may wish to think long and hard before accepting a job or work
assignment that forces you to work in isolation.  Choose a job that
lets you use your abilities to understand, predict and explain
reality.  Just try not to get so caught up in the world of ideas that
you miss out on directly experiencing life.  You may often find
yourself living more in the future than the present.   

<br/>
<br/>
Being an inventor or a promoter may attract you and, most likely, in
whatever work you choose, there will be a bit of the inventor/promoter
in whatever you do.  Watch out for times when life forces you to work
at a job that demands you make detailed observations and keep track of
facts and figures.  You will do better to target yourself towards work
that involves the big picture and bold concepts, not details and
precise facts. 

<br/>
<br/>
Look out if life corners you into an overly bureaucratic institution.
You will be interested in ideas, research and development, inventive
marketing or promotions- and you will pursue your interests by
thinking less about the rules, procedures and chains of command and
more about the end goal.  When you find that perfect job, employer or
co-workers, you will be valued for the glittering bundle of intuition
you provide as a catalyst to innovation and creative solutions. 

<br/>
<br/>
Life craves people like you and institutions need people like you,
although both may give you a hard time now and then.  Even if you
personally never get the pleasure of seeing your ideas put into
action, the probability is good that your innovations will eventually
trickle into the mainstream.  In the long run, you will be wise to
choose a career where you have autonomy over your work and where you
have the fellowship of other creative, like-minded people who also
admire ideas and prefer to work in less structured and non-confining
organisations.

<br/>
"I need to be doing something interesting as often as I can possibly
find something interesting to do. I need a lot of stimulation and I
tend to get bored quickly with things that are repetitive or easy to
figure out. I really like making up my own approaches to things, doing
things my own way, figuring out how things work by experimenting on my
own and putting different pieces together until they turn into
something meaningful...or at least something novel. I can find humor
in a lot of places other people wouldn't necessarily see it, and I
enjoy being able to entertain people with my knowledge and various
talents. I think I work best when I'm given an open-ended assignment
where I can suggest a lot of different possibilities, or connect
different ideas together to come up with something better than what
was there before. Sometimes I'm so busy thinking about different ideas
for changes that I lose sight of practical concerns--it's easy for me
to get caught up in the moment and forget about the needs of others
around me, although I do actually care about my friends and family a
lot more than more than my behavior sometimes suggests. I can get
distracted easily, because the most exciting thing for me is always
pursuing some kind of new experience or project. I really dislike it
when people insist on following traditions or rules that I can't see
any good reason for. Occasionally I even upset people without meaning
to--sometimes I have trouble understanding why people seem to get
upset so easily. I just can't be content living with things as they
are if I can think of a better way to approach them. Why accept
mundane repetition when you can find ways to make life more
interesting?" 

<br/>
<br/>
Although their positive qualities are often grossly exaggerated by
popular type profiles (you'll see them described as "unique",
"clever", and "visionary"), ENTPs are characterized primarily by their
desire to create this kind of impression on others. (Whether or not
it's actually true will vary greatly from individual to individual,
but apparently, it's worked well on most people who have written ENTP
profiles.) The other primary aspect of their cognitive approach is one
that's common to all four ExxP types: an exploratory attitude that
focuses predominantly on taking in the greatest quantity of new
external information possible. Learning and expanding takes priority
over all else, often at the expense of important practical
concerns. On typology forums, ENTPs often earn a well-deserved
reputation as trolls, not because they want to hurt anyone (in most
cases), but more often because their desire to experiment with their
external environments in order to generate novel and interesting
results outweighs their (often weak) concern for the feelings of
others. Like ESTPs, they rarely take issue with poking and prodding
others for reactions, especially when they think people are being too
uptight, but Ne tends to focus more on putting people in unfamiliar
situations in order to explore the patterns in their responses, as
opposed to Se's focus on creating an immediate sensory
spectacle. Needless to say, this tendency can result in some rather
unfortunate social and interpersonal consequences, leading to the
common difficulty xNxP types often face in deciding between
introversion and extroversion. The more they experiment on people and
receive negative results, the more ENTPs will learn to be more
cautious in their early interactions with new people. Because dominant
Ne can never really be sure if its peculiar brand of humor will
entertain, upset, or simply confuse new people, Ne dominants (and
especially ENTPs) often develop less immediate social ability than
other extroverted types. In many cases, it can become a difficult
chore to differentiate between ENTPs and INTPs in this regard, hence
the ENTP reputation for being "the most introverted extrovert." 

<br/>
<br/>
As with all Pe dominant types, many ENTPs face serious difficulty when
it comes to accepting and dealing with anything they find boring or
uninteresting. Most are not above cutting corners to avoid repetitive
tasks, develop shortcuts to make practical responsibilities easier or
less relevant, or simply experiment with methodology to look for new
approaches. Whether or not these experiments produce any genuinely
useful results is often a secondary concern behind whether they give
the ENTP something new or otherwise novel to think about, some new
system to toy around with and turn into something else. Dominant Ne
operates most comfortably by casting a wide net out into the world and
then sifting through whatever happens to come up. Like their ENFP
brethren, ENTPs are typically most at home in environments where they
can generate large numbers of new possible options, but they tend to
falter and tire quickly when required to evaluate those options and
select the most effective choice for moving forward. As long as
something still exists primarily as an idea or concept, as long as it
hasn't yet reached the concrete implementation stage, it's still open
to any number of theoretical changes, rewrites, and unexpected
positive developments. Often, the process of nailing down a precise
course of action threatens dominant Ne's desire for infinite
open-endedness and freedom to change its external approach abruptly on
a whim. Young ENTPs, especially, may have chronic issues with the
classic Ne dilemma: the real material world is rarely as exciting as
the possibility of change contained in a theoretical problem that
hasn't yet been nailed down. Once an idea takes concrete root in the
real world of real things, its sense of infinite possibility for
change is replaced by an impending sense of constrained creative
freedom: the now-evident realistic limitations can quickly lead
dominant Ne to lose interest and wander off to something less set in
stone, where the promise of tackling something different still holds
the allure of the unknown and unexpected. 

<br/>
<br/>
It's important to remember that, despite relatively common social
difficulties, ENTPs are still extroverts, and they still identify
chiefly with the external object, thus leading them to require
continual feedback and reassurace from others. While many ENTPs
(especially the young ones) may fervently deny their dependence on
using others as a springboard for their ideas, in truth they suffer
the same problem that plagues many ENFPs: they often have no idea
whether their ideas have any real merit until they receive feedback
from others. On the plus side, this means ENTPs will rarely dismiss a
problem until all possible avenues have been explored. ENTPs are often
appreciated by others for their unusual approaches and refusal to do
things the conventional way--this can have some incredible benefits in
situations where creative freedom is rewarded, and it's important for
most ENTPs to place themselves in situations where they can utilize
this attitude for positive gain. They'll rarely dismiss potential
approaches without at least trying them, and they often have a gift
for helping others to explore the possibilities of their own new
frontiers, which can often endear them to others and help to provide
the continual positive feedback they thrive on. On the downside, the
desire to explore every possibility for exploration's sake alone can
often eclipse the more important goal of setting a concrete objective
and determining the most effective methodology for completing it. It's
no secret that many ENTPs have difficulty finishing things--the
excitement of jumping into and intuitively exploring a new project
often gets the better of them. 

<br/>
<br/>
Auxiliary: Introverted Thinking (Ti)

<br/>
<br/>
"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are
the easiest person to fool."

<br/>
<br/>
--Richard Feynman, ENTP

<br/>
<br/>
It's easy for ENTPs to get caught up in the thrill of change and
experimentation with no real clear objective besides binging on new
information and imagining ways to create relationships between
unrelated external information. When an experiment ceases to provide
new or interesting results, it's all too often discarded in the
ongoing search for the potential of something better. In this way,
dominant Ne seems to epitomize the saying, "The grass is always
greener on the other side." While dominant Ne may bestow many ENTPs
with a number of creative gifts responsible for their reputation as
exuberant innovators (not the least of which is the oft-vaunted
ability to simplify complex ideas into much clearer terms by relating
them to similar concepts), it's important to recognize the limitations
on a mindset that depends essentially on throwing darts in random
directions until something interesting happens. Without a clear
structure, principle, or direction by which to derive meaning, the
ENTP may lose himself in mindless wandering and neglect to complete
the aspects of projects that don't excite his sense of possibility.

<br/>
<br/>
Here we enter the vital role of auxiliary Ti: a subjective, grounding
sense of ordered meaning that grants form and conceptual purpose to
Ne's insatiable taste for the unknown. On a basic level, Ti allows the
ENTP to define and rationalize his own sense of causal reasoning, to
decide upon the rules by which he will judge the presence of
meaningful consistency in everything he attempts to grasp. As Ti
develops its methodology and approach to systematizing and
categorizing the constant inflow of information, Ne will begin to
explore for a genuine purpose, to internalize the causality and
implied meaning of its forays. Development of Ti is crucial to the
ENTP's true self-actualization: though they may appear wildly
confident (even overconfident) to outsiders, ENTPs develop most of
their true self-confidence through Ti. It adds a sense of appreciation
for grasping and fully categorizing the nature of self, creating an
overarching sense of the reasoning and integrity of ideas and
structural concepts. While it can suffer stubbornness when of its
principles is violated, Ti serves the important purpose of reminding
the ENTP that she can't always find every answer with another
experiment. Continual analysis and correction of the "internal model"
will occur as the ENTP gains more experience with an ever-growing
number of new ideas and conceptual associations. Ti functions as an
internal litmus test for the validity (and by extension, virtue) of
any idea, person, design, or concept. Without it, the ENTP is utterly
at the mercy of the opinions and perceptions of everyone on whom he
depends for validation. He may cycle endlessly through different
changes of environment only to find that the real change needed to
come from within. With the development of Ti, the ENTP will develop a
set of personal principles that, for once, do not depend on generating
a reaction or response from the external environment. She will learn
to do things for her own reasons instead of continually shifting with
the tides of the approval and adulation of others.

<br/>
<br/>
On the downside, if auxiliary Ti is overapplied, the ENTP may begin to
resemble a more outgoing and inflexible INTP, insisting on the
correctness of his own reasoning and evaluation, but lacking the level
of discernment and introspection that makes Ti a viable dominant
function for INTPs. ENTPs who overestimate the objectivity of their
own sense of logic may often find themselves alienating potential
social contacts with an overwhelming sense of self-righteous
insistence on the validity of their own values and reasoning. Their
insistence on deriving causal principles from individual experience
instead of objectively validated methodology is something of a
double-edged sword: while they may avoid errors in framework-oriented
reasoning derived from group-think, they sometimes end up spending
tremendous amounts of time and resources exploring methods and forms
of reasoning that, for good reason, have already been explored and
dismissed by the greater community. The desire to form an unorthodox
method derives as much from Ne's need to be viewed by others as unique
and creative as it does from Ti's need to formulate frameworks of
structural reasoning from an individualized perspective. Ironically,
the harder he works to create the impression that his style is unique
and unexpected (Ne), the more he shuts out established convention (Ti)
in an effort to generate a perspective and approach which stands out
from the crowd (Ne). Ideally, these two primary functions should
inspire each other toward a balanced form of personalized
developmental progress: Ne casts a net to find as much new information
as possible, Ti arranges and organizes this data into meaningful
blocks which follow its principles, and then Ne goes to work building
new formations of the most recently created data blocks. Mastering the
balance between these two processes is a vital component of the ENTP's
fully actualized personality.

<br/>
<br/>
Tertiary: Extroverted Feeling (Fe)

<br/>
<br/>
When developed in a productive way, tertiary Fe allows ENTPs to begin
learning to relate to others in terms of externalized moral judgment
instead of simply in terms of creating interesting impressions and
experimenting on others for reactions. With the development of Fe, the
ENTP's characteristic blunt insensitivity will gradually give way to a
more significant sense of familial and cultural responsibility. The
people on whom the ENTP has depended for validation and feedback her
entire life (often without realizing the extent of their importance)
may suddenly strike her as far more meaningful and worthy of respect
and admiration. Childish insistence on always being right and
constantly seeking novelty will move aside in favor of a more
realistic sense of the responsibilities of adult life as the needs,
desires, and cultural beliefs of important people in the ENTP's life
begin to strike him as genuinely meaningful and worthwhile. With Ti
and Fe in place, a balance can be reached between living up to
individual principles and fulfilling real-world expectations and
obligations. The Fe-savvy ENTP understands how to integrate into the
social and moral fabric of the people he values most--though
reconciling his personal desires with the needs of others when he
finds their beliefs unreasonable may be one of life's more difficult
challenges.

<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, Fe development should occur once Ti recognizes that there is
a valid and inherently consistent reason for collectivized moral
judgment to arise and guide the structure of interpersonal
relationships. Earlier in life, it's all too common for ENTPs to
expect continual validation, encouragement, and attention from the
people they find interesting, but without the balancing influence of
Fe, they rarely recognize the imbalance between how much they take and
how much they give to the people closest to them. When confronted with
this disparity, it's not uncommon for tertiary Fe to spring into
action and promote feelings of guilt and self-criticism, but the
process of learning to correct this disparity is a vital part of
developing adult relationships where ENTPs are willing and able to
give as much as they often unconsciously take. Giving up the logical
high ground may prove difficult for the young ENTP's ego to swallow,
but it's a vital step toward personal balance that's responsible for a
great deal of the gradual movement from pure hedonistic exploration
toward a more well-rounded outlook and a serious understanding of and
respect for the needs and sentiments of those close to them. Though
they do tend to mature slowly in general, it's not uncommon to see
abrupt and unexpected leaps in perspective in this area, especially
when the ENTP admires or strives to emulate a close friend or family
member with strong Fe. While most ENTPs tend to idolize other NPs in
their search for identity, it's often useful for young adult ENTPs to
develop close relationships with xxFJ types, as a number of important
and growth-inspiring perspectives and interpersonal strategies can be
garnered from this sort of interaction.

<br/>
<br/>
The emergence of tertiary Fe occurs at a pretty young age for most
ENTPs; however, without the balancing influence of Ti (which may come
much later for many), it tends to result in mostly negative
applications. The NeFe loop ENTP exudes tremendous false confidence,
but in reality has very few internal principles by which to check the
opinions and perceptions of others against his own value system. He
does lip service to a philosophy of integrity of independent thought,
but in reality is a slave to the perceptions and expectations of
others. He appears confident because he recognizes that confidence
tends to favorably color the perceptions of others--or at the very
least, provoke some sort of reaction, which will provide some form of
feedback. This desire for novel reactions often combines with weak
Fe's rudimentary awareness of what sorts of approaches will upset or
offend people: the drive to experiment with people's reactions is
there, but it lacks the nuance to grasp the real implications of what
it's doing. The result is the classic ENTP question: "Why does
everyone get upset so easily?" In reality, this is only partially
true: often, it is the ENTP's own Fe mistakes that result in her
interpersonal difficulties.

<br/>
<br/>
Of course, young ENTPs may also overestimate their own ability to
avoid emotional influence, as is typical for many T types. Poor Fe may
often result in the distortion of reasoning that occurs when someone
the ENTP respects and admires comes into conflict with someone she
doesn't: suddenly, unconscious interpersonal loyalties may override
Ti's better judgment, resulting in a form of conformity the ENTP may
not realize is intended to uphold her positive image with people she
finds interesting and worthwhile. In many ways, Fe can contribute both
positively and negatively to Ne's dependence on the approval of
others. When applied in excess, this can undermine any sense of
legitimate self-confidence; when applied in the right proportion, it
grounds the ENTP with a much-needed awareness of interpersonal, moral,
and social norms and standards.

<br/>
<br/>
Inferior: Introverted Sensation (Si)

<br/>
<br/>
A peculiar relationship seems to occur between ENTPs and their
inferior attitude of introverted sensation. Si appears quite often
during stressful periods and depressed burnouts, both brief and
lengthy. As its attitude appears on the surface to completely
contradict the doctrine of Ne, its insistence on preparedness and its
dislike for unexpected surprises seem quite at odds with the way most
ENTPs prefer to lead their lives. The idea that one should restrain
oneself for the purpose of avoiding unexpected negative effects of
change and experimentation strikes young ENTPs as bizarre and
confusing. The wisdom in the phrase, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
may take years to occur to the ENTP, who makes it his business to
"fix" everything just to create more opportunities to discover
something different, broken or not. The practical value in generating
more certainty and focusing on more complete and specific sensory
internalization can feel so repetitive and uninteresting that its
actual value can seem nearly incomprehensible.

<br/>
<br/>
As with all types, the inferior function is most typically
unconscious, poorly developed, and unable to operate on a competent
adult level in most situations. One common manifestation involves the
dreaded Ne dominant burnout: when too much exploration too fast
results in a string of difficult failures, inferior Si may actually
develop a painful aversion to dominant Ne's treasured sense of
exploratory freedom. By overextending in too many different directions
at once, the inferior function can actually step in as a defense
mechanism against the negative experiences of trying new things and
failing too many times in a row with not enough reassuring successes
(note the general dependence on external validation) to balance it
out. The effects on the depressed ENTP's worldview can be
catastrophic: frozen in place by fear of failure, Si may push his
entire lifestyle into a risk-averse and sedentary mindset that shuts
off the area of cognition which makes him feel most
fulfilled. Blocking out new external information as a result,
so-called "blow-ups" of inferior Si may lead the ENTP to retreat into
familiar experiences where she can avoid the sting of failure by
dumbing down the external challenge until she knows it will fit within
her drastically reduced comfort zone. It's not uncommon to see ENTPs
engaging in repetitive and simplistic problem-solving of issues
they've mastered years before: when the stress of consistent failure
overwhelms Ne's desire for more experimentation, Si takes over and
temporarily forces a return to the known and established, the
consistency of certainty. 

<br/>
<br/>
In other cases, inferior Si may undermine dominant Ne by gripping the
ENTP with an overwhelming fear that his situation will become
permanently and irreversibly static. If not enough opportunites for
innovation and external stimulation are provided, Ne's predictive
ability and eye for forward trends can sabotage themselves: suddenly,
the worst case scenario--total absence of change and
stimulation--becomes an impending fear. Ne's worst fear, of course, is
simply the loss of creative freedom, of forced adherence to a
repetitive and predictable set of non-stimulating information. The
more the ENTP fails to create new and challenging situations for
herself, the more she becomes bound to her own self-fulfilling
prophecy of repetitive failure to progress, dooming herself to a life
of mundanity and destroying the spontaneous inspiration under which
she feels most fulfilled.

<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side, however, Si should eventually fall into place as
a safe anchor for Ne's limitless explorations. It takes a long time
for most ENTPs to accept their own limitations and find their niche in
life, but when this occurs, it's almost certainly related to the
difficult but important development of the inferior attitude. As
cognition gradually centers around a coherent identity, the ENTP
should eventually recognize that, somewhat counterintuitively, working
to establish more permanance and predictability can actually help
appease his desire for constant change and stimulation. Once he
recognizes that his desire for constant change can actually be
interpreted as a need for a consistent form of experience, he can
begin to appreciate Si's role as a practical counterweight to the wild
unpredictability of Ne as a constant lifestyle. If one fails to
establish any predictable level of permanency in life, practical
concerns ultimately circumvent Ne's ability to achieve the level of
novel creation it most deeply desires: without at least some
rudimentary attention to the world of consistent expectations and
comfort in repetition, the ENTP sabotages his own ability to maintain
the high-stimulation lifestyle in which he feels most at home. With a
little more attention paid to preserving the good things about the
experiences they're accustomed to, ENTPs will finally gain the one
thing they need most: appreciation for the little things they take for
granted, and all the genuine satisfaction and self-confidence that
accompanies it.

<br/>
<br/>

ENTPs value their ability to use imagination and innovation to deal
with problems. Trusting in their ingenuity to get them out of trouble,
they often neglect to prepare sufficiently for any given
situation. This characteristic, combined with their tendency to
underestimate the time needed to complete a project, may cause the
ENTP to become over-extended, and to work frequently beyond expected
time limits. Complicating this situation is their predisposition to
experiment with new solutions. This makes them eager to move on to the
next challenge when things get boring. ENTPs become stressed when
their improvisational abilities are ineffective and they will avoid
circumstances where they might fail.

<br/>
<br/>

If stress continues, ENTPs become distracted and their "can do"
attitude is threatened. Feelings of incompetence, ineptness, and
inadequacy take over. They need to escape situations that are
associated with anxiety is more prominent for the ENTP than for any
other personality type. Doubtful of whether they will have what it
takes to accomplish a task, they displace their fears onto situations
they can elude. Panic, fear, and anxiety then block the expression of
their creativity. Defensive phobic reactions cause the ENTP to
circumvent achievement in other areas and prevent the success they
strive on.
