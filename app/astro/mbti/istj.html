<h3>ISTJ</h3>

http://typelogic.com/istj.html

<br/>
<br/>

"It is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that I should express
simply and directly the opinions which I hold concerning some of the matters of
present importance." --Herbert Hoover, Inaugural Address, Monday, March 4, 1929.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs are often called inspectors. They have a keen sense of right and wrong,
especially in their area of interest and/or responsibility. They are noted for
devotion to duty. Punctuality is a watchword of the ISTJ. The secretary, clerk,
or business(wo)man by whom others set their clocks is likely to be an ISTJ.

<br/>
<br/>

As do other Introverted Thinkers, ISTJs often give the initial impression of
being aloof and perhaps somewhat cold. Effusive expression of emotional warmth
is not something that ISTJs do without considerable energy loss.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs are most at home with "just the facts, Ma'am." They seem to perform at
highest efficiency when employing a step-by-step approach. Once a new procedure
has proven itself (i.e., has been shown "to work,") the ISTJ can be depended
upon to carry it through, even at the expense of their own health.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs are easily frustrated by the inconsistencies of others, especially when
the second parties don't keep their commitments. But they usually keep their
feelings to themselves unless they are asked. And when asked, they don't mince
words. Truth wins out over tact. The grim determination of the ISTJ vindicates
itself in officiation of sports events, judiciary functions, or an other
situation which requires making tough calls and sticking to them.

<br/>
<br/>

His SJ orientation draws the ISTJ into the service of established
institutions. Home, social clubs, government, schools, the military, churches --
these are the bastions of the SJ. "We've always done it this way" is often
reason enough for many ISTJs. Threats to time-honored traditions or established
organizations (e.g., a "run" on the bank) are the undoing of SJs, and are to be
fought at all costs.

<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

Si is oriented toward the world of forms, essences, generics. Time is such a
form, a quantifiable essense of exactitude, the standard to which external
events are held. For both of the IS_J types, the sense of propriety comes from
the clear definition of these internal forms. An apple "should" have certain
qualities, against which all apples are evaluated. A "proper" chair has four
legs, (and other qualities this poor INTP can only guess). Jung viewed
introverted sensing as something of an oxymoron, in that the natural direction
of senses is outward toward the object, rather than inward and away from it. One
has the sense that Introverted Sensors are drawn more to the measure of the
concept of the perceived object than to the experience of that perception.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

The moderation of the Te function serves to socialize the expression of these
forms. When the Si function is ready to relinquish the data, Te may
speak. Otherwise, silence is golden. ISTJs seem to have a few favorite forms
(the tried and true) which may serve for most occasions. My ISTJ dad woke me
every morning with the same phrase for more years than I care to
remember. Asked, "How are you?" he answered with the same stock phrase. ("As
well as my age and habits will permit" was used for about two decades.) "It's a
good form, a sound form--it's the form for me."

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

Since Fi is turned inward, it is rarely expressed. Perhaps this enables the ISTJ
to resolutely accept that "we are all doomed." When told that Lazarus had died,
Thomas said, "Let us go and die with him." (He could just as well have said
something like, "I knew this was bound to happen sooner or later.") Only in
times of great distress is the Introverted Feeling expressed (as I witnessed in
my dad when a neighbor's son was killed in a hunting accident). Otherwise,
feeling is inferred, or expressed nonverbally, through eye contact, or an
encouraging smile.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Intuition

<br/>
<br/>

The Ne function of an ISTJ does not serve her very well. It needs a lot of
help. She was surprised, for example, to find that someone she had talked with
only by phone had red hair, because she "didn't usually like" people with red
hair! This inferior Ne seems to be a major source of, and a natural breeding
ground for, stereotypes. Failure of the banking system is but one bogeyman which
arises from the fear which feeds on the ISTJ's mistrust of real world
possibilities. The shadow inhabiting the inferior Ne strikes at the precious
forms and standards in the heart of the dominant Si function.

The Duty Fulfiller

<br/>
<br/>

As an ISTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take
things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary
mode is external, where you deal with things rationally and logically.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and
peaceful living. They have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty, which lends
them a serious air and the motivation to follow through on tasks. Organized and
methodical in their approach, they can generally succeed at any task which they
undertake.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs are very loyal, faithful, and dependable. They place great importance on
honesty and integrity. They are "good citizens" who can be depended on to do the
right thing for their families and communities. While they generally take things
very seriously, they also usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a
lot of fun - especially at family or work-related gatherings.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from
others. They're not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the
rules. If they are able to see a good reason for stepping outside of the
established mode of doing things, the ISTJ will support that effort. However,
ISTJs more often tend to believe that things should be done according to
procedures and plans. If an ISTJ has not developed their Intuitive side
sufficiently, they may become overly obsessed with structure, and insist on
doing everything "by the book".

<br/>
<br/>

The ISTJ is extremely dependable on following through with things which he or
she has promised. For this reason, they sometimes get more and more work piled
on them. Because the ISTJ has such a strong sense of duty, they may have a
difficult time saying "no" when they are given more work than they can
reasonably handle. For this reason, the ISTJ often works long hours, and may be
unwittingly taken advantage of.

<br/>
<br/>

The ISTJ will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts of energy
into doing any task which they see as important to fulfilling a goal. However,
they will resist putting energy into things which don't make sense to them, or
for which they can't see a practical application. They prefer to work alone, but
work well in teams when the situation demands it. They like to be accountable
for their actions, and enjoy being in positions of authority. The ISTJ has
little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the practical application is
clear.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs have tremendous respect for facts. They hold a tremendous store of facts
within themselves, which they have gathered through their Sensing
preference. They may have difficulty understanding a theory or idea which is
different from their own perspective. However, if they are shown the importance
or relevance of the idea to someone who they respect or care about, the idea
becomes a fact, which the ISTJ will internalize and support. Once the ISTJ
supports a cause or idea, he or she will stop at no lengths to ensure that they
are doing their duty of giving support where support is needed.

<br/>
<br/>

The ISTJ is not naturally in tune with their own feelings and the feelings of
others. They may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs immediately, as
they are presented. Being perfectionists themselves, they have a tendency to
take other people's efforts for granted, like they take their own efforts for
granted. They need to remember to pat people on the back once in a while.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs are likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to
others. However, their strong sense of duty and the ability to see what needs to
be done in any situation usually allows them to overcome their natural
reservations, and they are usually quite supporting and caring individuals with
the people that they love. Once the ISTJ realizes the emotional needs of those
who are close to them, they put forth effort to meet those needs.
<br/>
<br/>


The ISTJ is extremely faithful and loyal. Traditional and family-minded, they
will put forth great amounts of effort at making their homes and families
running smoothly. They are responsible parents, taking their parenting roles
seriously. They are usually good and generous providers to their families. They
care deeply about those close to them, although they usually are not comfortable
with expressing their love. The ISTJ is likely to express their affection
through actions, rather than through words.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it,
plan it, and implement it through to completion. They are very hard workers, who
do not allow obstacles to get in the way of performing their duties. They do not
usually give themselves enough credit for their achievements, seeing their
accomplishments simply as the natural fulfillment of their obligations.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs usually have a great sense of space and function, and artistic
appreciation. Their homes are likely to be tastefully furnished and immaculately
maintained. They are acutely aware of their senses, and want to be in
surroundings which fit their need for structure, order, and beauty.

<br/>
<br/>

Under stress, ISTJs may fall into "catastrophe mode", where they see nothing but
all of the possibilities of what could go wrong. They will berate themselves for
things which they should have done differently, or duties which they failed to
perform. They will lose their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and
will depress themselves with their visions of doom.

<br/>
<br/>

In general, the ISTJ has a tremendous amount of potential. Capable, logical,
reasonable, and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote
security and peaceful living, the ISTJ has what it takes to be highly effective
at achieving their chosen goals - whatever they may be.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTJ

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ISTJs as Inspectors, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Guardians.[2] ISTJs account for about 10-14% of the
population.[2][3]

<br/>
<br/>

* I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: ISTJs tend to be quiet and
  reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather
  than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social
  situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ISTJs tend to be more concrete than
  abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than the big
  picture, and on immediate realities rather than future possibilities.[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* T - Thinking preferred to feeling: ISTJs tend to value objective criteria
  above personal preference. When making decisions, they generally give more
  weight to logic than to social considerations.[8]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* J - Judgment preferred to perception: ISTJs tend to plan their activities and
  make decisions early. They derive a sense of control through
  predictability. [9]

ISTJ characteristics

<br/>
<br/>

Type description

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs thrive on organization. They keep their lives and environments
well-regulated. They bring painstaking attention to detail in their work and
will not rest until a job is well completed.[12] They are often dissatisfied
with unresolved issues, whether in life or in fiction.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs are faithful, logical, organized, sensible, and earnest
traditionalists. They earn success by thoroughness and dependability. Shutting
out distractions, they take a practical, logical approach to their
endeavors. Realistic and responsible, they work steadily toward their
goals. They enjoy creating order in both their professional and personal lives.

<br/>
<br/>

Despite their focus on their internal world, ISTJs prefer dealing with the present and the factual. Keen observers of life, they weigh various options when making decisions. ISTJs are well-prepared for most eventualities and have a good understanding of most situations. They believe in practical objectives, and they value traditions and loyalty.

<br/>
<br/>

For the Keirsey description, see Inspector (Role Variant).

<br/>
<br/>

Learning

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs learn best and apply themselves to subjects that they deem practical and
useful. As learners, ISTJs tend to need materials, directions, and teachers to
be precise and accurate if they are to trust the information that is
presented. They prefer concrete and useful applications and will tolerate theory
only if it leads to these ends.

<br/>
<br/>

They like learning activities that allow them time to reflect and
think. Material that seems too easy or too enjoyable leads ISTJs to be skeptical
of its merit. Because of their practical outlook, ISTJs clearly delineate
between work and play. Therefore, their ideal learning environment is
task-oriented, has a clear schedule, and has a clear and precise assignment.

<br/>
<br/>

Working

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs respect facts. They hold a tremendous store of data within themselves,
gathered through their Sensing function. They may have difficulty valuing a
theory or idea that differs from their own perspective. However, if they are
shown the importance or relevance of the idea by someone whom they respect or
care about, the idea becomes a fact that the ISTJ will internalize and
vigorously support.

<br/>
<br/>

ISTJs often work for long periods, devoting their energy to tasks that they see
as important to fulfilling a goal. However, they resist putting energy into
things that don't make sense to them, or for which they can't see a practical
application. They prefer to work alone but can work well in teams when the
situation demands it. They like to be accountable for their actions, and they
enjoy positions of responsibility. They have little use for theory or abstract
thinking, unless the practical application is clear.

<br/>
<br/>

In general, ISTJs are capable, logical, reasonable, and effective individuals
with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peaceful living. They can be
highly effective at achieving their goals-whatever those may be.

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functions (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) form a
hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's so-called default pattern of
behavior.

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information gathering
function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making function
(thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less developed
than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding out the
person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's Achilles'
heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the Tertiary,
the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[13]

<br/>
<br/>

Jung and Myers considered the attitude of the Auxiliary, Tertiary, and Inferior functions to be the opposite of the Dominant. In this interpretation, if the Dominant function is extraverted, then the other three are introverted, and vice versa. However, many modern practitioners hold that the attitude of the Tertiary function is the same as the Dominant.[5]

<br/>
<br/>

Using the more modern interpretation, the cognitive functions of the ISTJ are as
follows:[13]

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Introverted sensing (Si)

<br/>
<br/>

Si collects data in the present moment and compares it with past experiences, a
process that sometimes evokes the feelings associated with memory, as if the
subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect what is familiar, Si draws upon
history to form goals and expectations about what will happen in the future.[14]
Using Si, ISTJs thrive on deep analysis of their surroundings.[13]
