<h3>ENFP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/enfp.html

<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs are both "idea"-people and "people"-people, who see everyone and
everything as part of a cosmic whole. They want to both help and to be liked and
admired by other people, on both an individual and a humanitarian level. This is
rarely a problem for the ENFP, as they are outgoing and warm, and genuinely like
people. Some ENFPs have a great deal of zany charm, which can ingratiate them to
more stodgy types in spite of their unconventionality.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs often have strong, if sometimes surprising, values and viewpoints. They
tend to try to use their social skills and contacts to persuade others gently
(though enthusiastically) of the rightness of these views; this sometimes
results in the ENFP neglecting their nearest and dearest while caught up their
efforts to change the world.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs can be the warmest, kindest, and most sympathetic of mates; affectionate,
demonstrative, and spontaneous. Many in relationships with an ENFP literally
say, "They light up my life." But there is usually a trade-off: the partner must
be willing to deal with the practical and financial aspects of the relationship,
and the ENFP must be allowed the freedom to follow their latest path, whatever
that entails.
<br/>
<br/>

For some ENFPs, relationships can be seriously tested by their short attention
spans and emotional needs. They are easily intrigued and distracted by new
friends and acquaintances, forgetting their older and more familiar emotional
ties for long stretches at a time. And the less mature ENFP may need to feel
theyâ€™re the constant center of attention, to confirm their image of themselves
as a wonderful and fascinating person.
<br/>
<br/>

In the workplace, ENFPs are pleasant and friendly, and interact in a positive
and creative manner with both their co-workers and the public. ENFPs are also a
major asset in brainstorming sessions; follow-through on projects can be a
problem, however. ENFPs do get distracted, especially if another interesting
issue comes along. They also tend towards procrastination, and dislike
performing small, uninteresting tasks. ENFPs are most productive when working in
a group with a few Js to handle the details and the deadlines.

<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs are friendly folks. Most are really enjoyable people. Some of the most
soft-hearted people are ENFPs.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs have what some call a "silly switch." They can be intellectual, serious,
all business for a while, but whenever they get the chance, they flip that
switch and become CAPTAIN WILDCHILD, the scourge of the swimming pool, ticklers
par excellence. Som etimes they may even appear intoxicated when the "switch" is
flipped.

<br/>
<br/>
One study has shown that ENFPs are significantly overrepresented in
psychodrama. Most have a natural propensity for role-playing and acting.

<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs like to tell funny stories, especially about their friends. This penchant
may be why many are attracted to journalism. I kid one of my ENFP friends that
if I want the sixth fleet to know something, I'll just tell him.

<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs are global learners. Close enough is satisfactory to the ENFP, which may
unnerve more precise thinking types, especially with such things as piano
practice ("three quarter notes or four ... what's the difference?") Amazingly,
some ENFPs are adept at exacting disciplines such as mathematics.

<br/>
<br/>
Friends are what life is about to ENFPs, moreso even than the other NFs. They
hold up their end of the relationship, sometimes being victimized by less caring
individuals. ENFPs are energized by being around people. Some have real
difficulty being alone , especially on a regular basis.
<br/>
<br/>

One ENFP colleague, a social worker, had such tremendous interpersonal skills
that she put her interviewers at ease during her own job interview. She had the
ability to make strangers feel like old friends.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs sometimes can be blindsided by their secondary Feeling function. Hasty
decisions based on deeply felt values may boil over with unpredictable
results. More than one ENFP has abruptly quit a job in such a moment. 

<br/>
<br/>
Extraverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>
The physical world, both geos and kosmos, is the ENFP's primary source of
information. Rather than sensing things as they are, dominant intuition is
sensitive to things as they might be. These extraverted intuitives are most
adept with patterns and connections. Their natural inclination is toward
relationships, especially among people or living things.

<br/>
<br/>
Intuition leans heavily on feeling for meaning and focus. Its best patterns
reflect the interesting points of people, giving rise to caricatures of manner,
speech and expression.
<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling
<br/>
<br/>

Auxiliary feeling is nonverbally implied more often than it is openly
expressed. When expressed, this logic has an aura of romance and purity that may
seem out of place in this flawed, imperfect world. In its own defense, feeling
judgement frequently and fleetly gives way to humor. ENFPs who publicize their
feelings too often may put off some of the crowd of friends they naturally
attract.
<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking
<br/>
<br/>

Thinking, the process which runs to impersonal conclusions, holds the
extraverted tertiary position. Used on an occasional basis, ENFPs may benefit
greatly from this ability. Less mature and lacking the polish of higher order
functions, Thinking is not well suited to be used as a prominent function. As
with other FP types, the ENFP unwary of Thinking's limitations may find
themselves most positively mistaken.
<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Sensing
<br/>
<br/>

Sensing, the least discernible ENFP function, resides in the inner world where
reality is reduced to symbols and icons--ideas representing essences of external
realities. Under the influence of the ever-present intuition, the ENFP's sensory
perceptions are in danger of being replaced by hypothetical data consistent with
pattern and paradigm. When it is protected and nourished, introverted sensing
provides information about the fixed. From such firm anchoring ENFPs are best
equipped to launch into thousands of plausibilities and curiosities yet to be
imagined.
<br/>
<br/>

Perhaps the combination of introverted Feeling and childlike introverted Sensing
is responsible for the silent pull of ENFPs to the wishes of parents, authority
figures and friends. Or perhaps it's the predominance of indecisive intuition in
combination with the ambiguity of secondary Fi and tertiary Te that induces
these kind souls to capitulate even life-affecting decisions. Whatever the
dynamic, ENFPs are strongly influenced by the opinions of their friends.

<br/>
As an ENFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take
things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where
you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit in
with your personal value system.

<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of
potential. They live in the world of possibilities, and can become very
passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the ability to
inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk
their way in or out of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift,
and strive to make the most out of it.

<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most
things which interest them. Project-oriented, they may go through several
different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers, the ENFP may seem
directionless and without purpose, but ENFPs are actually quite consistent, in
that they have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their
lives. Everything that they do must be in line with their values. An ENFP needs
to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in step
with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a
continuous quest to adapt their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They're
constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing touch with themselves. Since
emotional excitement is usually an important part of the ENFP's life, and
because they are focused on keeping "centered", the ENFP is usually an intense
individual, with highly evolved values.

<br/>
<br/>

An ENFP needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a
problem area for some of these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types,
ENFPs need time alone to center themselves, and make sure they are moving in a
direction which is in sync with their values. ENFPs who remain centered will
usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit
of dropping a project when they become excited about a new possibility, and thus
they never achieve the great accomplishments which they are capable of
achieving.

<br/>
<br/>

Most ENFPs have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in
people, and place great importance on their inter-personal relationships. ENFPs
almost always have a strong need to be liked. Sometimes, especially at a younger
age, an ENFP will tend to be "gushy" and insincere, and generally "overdo" in an
effort to win acceptance. However, once an ENFP has learned to balance their
need to be true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at
bringing out the best in others, and are typically well-liked. They have an
exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short period
of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their
own level.

<br/>
<br/>

Because ENFPs live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of
everyday life are seen as trivial drudgery. They place no importance on
detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain oblivous to these
types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy
themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most ENFPs, and can be
frustrating for ENFP's family members.

<br/>
<br/>
An ENFP who has "gone wrong" may be quite manipulative - and very good it. The
gift of gab which they are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get
what they want. Most ENFPs will not abuse their abilities, because that would
not jive with their value systems.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to
intuitively perceive the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply
judgment to their perception, they may jump to the wrong conclusions.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining
happy in marital relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could
be, they may become bored with what actually is. The strong sense of values will
keep many ENFPs dedicated to their relationships. However, ENFPs like a little
excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are
comfortable with change and new experiences.

<br/>
<br/>
Having an ENFP parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at
times for children with strong Sensing or Judging tendancies. Such children may
see the ENFP parent as inconsistent and difficult to understand, as the children
are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the ENFP. Sometimes the ENFP will want
to be their child's best friend, and at other times they will play the parental
authoritarian. But ENFPs are always consistent in their value systems, which
they will impress on their children above all else, along with a basic joy of
living.
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined
to strict schedules or mundane tasks. Consequently, ENFPs work best in
situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and where they can work with
people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to
be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about
what they're doing.
<br/>
<br/>

Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments,
ENFPs often suffer from muscle tension. They have a strong need to be
independent, and resist being controlled or labelled. They need to maintain
control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their
dislike of dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to
themselves.

<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented
individuals with capabilities ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many
gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those near them, if they are
able to remain centered and master the ability of following through.

<br/>
Keirsey referred to ENFPs as Champions, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Idealists.[2] ENFPs account for about 2-8% of the
population.

<br/>
<br/>
* E - Extraversion preferred to introversion: ENFPs often feel motivated by
  their interaction with people. They tend to enjoy a wide circle of
  acquaintances, and they gain energy in social situations (whereas introverts
  expend energy).[7]
<br/>
<br/>
  
* N - Intuition preferred to sensing: ENFPs tend to be more abstract than
  concrete. They focus their attention on the big picture rather than the
  details, and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities.[8]
<br/>
<br/>
  
* F - Feeling preferred to thinking: ENFPs tend to value personal considerations
  above objective criteria. When making decisions, they often give more weight
  to social implications than to logic.[9]
  
<br/>
<br/>
* P - Perception preferred to judgment: ENFPs tend to withhold judgment and
  delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should
  circumstances change.[10]
  
<br/>
<br/>

ENFPs are initiators of change, keenly perceptive of possibilities. They
energize and stimulate others through their contagious enthusiasm. They prefer
the start-up phase of a project or relationship, and are tireless in the pursuit
of new-found interests. ENFPs are able to anticipate the needs of others and to
offer them needed help and appreciation. They bring zest, joy, liveliness, and
fun to all aspects of their lives. They are at their best in fluid situations
that allow them to express their creativity and use their charisma. They tend to
idealize people, and can be disappointed when reality fails to fulfill their
expectations. They are easily frustrated if a project requires a great deal of
follow-up or attention to detail.  Keirsey descriptions

<br/>
<br/>
Champions delight in novelty. They are optimistic, enthusiastic, and vivacious,
craving expressions of strong emotion. With a dramatic flair, they share their
experiences with others, hoping to reveal some universal truth or win others
over in support of a cause. Attuned to possibilities, Champions scan their
environment, probing the emotions, needs, and motivations of others. This
sensitivity sometimes conflicts with their intense drive for personal
authenticity. Spontaneous and personable, they attract others to their
company.[3]
