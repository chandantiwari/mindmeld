<h3>B</h3>
<p> 
B Is for Balance - B Blood Type History 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
Blood Type B developed in the area of the Himalayan highlands, now part of 
present day Pakistan and India. Pushed from the hot, lush savannahs of eastern 
Africa to the cold highlands of the Himalayan Mountains, Blood type B may have 
initially mutated in response to climactic changes. It first appeared in India 
or the Ural region of Asia among a mix of Caucasian and Mongolian tribes. This 
new blood type was soon characteristic of the great tribes of steppe dwellers, 
who by this time dominated the Eurasian Plains. As the Mongolians swept through 
Asia, the gene for Type B blood was firmly entrenched. The Mongolians swept 
northward, pursuing a culture dependent upon herding and domesticating animals - 
as their diet of meat and cultured dairy products reflected.

What Makes Type B Unique 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
As a Type B, you carry the genetic potential for great malleability and the 
ability to thrive in changeable conditions. Unlike blood types A and O, which 
are at opposite ends of every spectrum, your position is fluid, rather than 
stationary, with the ability to move in either direction along the 
continuum. It's easy to see how this flexibility served the interests of early 
Type B's who needed to balance the twin forces of the animal and vegetable 
kingdoms. At the same time, it can be extremely challenging to balance two poles 
and Type B's tend to be highly sensitive to the effects of slipping out of 
balance.  
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
The primary challenges that can get in the way of optimum health for Type B
include a tendency to produce higher than normal cortisol levels in situations
to stress; sensitivity to the B specific lectins in select foods, resulting in
inflammation and greater risk for developing Syndrome X; susceptibility to slow
growing, lingering viruses - such as those for MS, CFS, and lupus; and a
vulnerability to autoimmune diseases. "If I were to generalize," says
Dr. D'Adamo, "I would say that a healthy Type B, living right for his or her own
type, tends to have fewer risk factors for disease and tends to be more
physically fit and mentally balanced than any of the other blood types." Type
B's tended to have a greater ability to adapt to altitude and interestingly, are
statistically the tallest of the blood types. Type B's are also physically the
strongest among other types.

<br/> 
 
Type B Diet 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
For Type Bs the biggest factors in weight gain are corn, wheat, buckwheat, 
lentils, tomatoes, peanuts and sesame seeds. Each of these foods affect the 
efficiency of your metabolic process, resulting in fatigue, fluid retention, and 
hypoglycemia - a severe drop in blood sugar after eating a meal. When you 
eliminate these foods and begin eating a diet that is right for your type, you 
blood sugar levels should remain normal after meals. Another very common food 
that Type Bs should avoid is chicken. Chicken contains a Blood Type B 
agglutinating lectin in its muscle tissue. Although chicken is a lean meat, the 
issue is the power of an agglutinating lectin attacking your bloodstream and the 
potential for it to lead to strokes and immune disorders. Dr. D'Adamo suggests 
that you wean yourself away from chicken and replace them with highly beneficial 
foods such as goat, lamb, mutton, rabbit and venison. Other foods that encourage 
weight loss are green vegetables, eggs, beneficial meats, and low fat 
dairy. When the toxic foods are avoided and replaced with beneficial foods, 
Blood Type Bs are very successful in controlling their weight.  
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
Handling Stress 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
When it comes to hormones, type B is closer to type A, producing somewhat higher 
levels of cortisol. When a Type B is out of balance, this manifests in 
overreaction to stress, difficulty in recovering from stress, disrupted sleep 
patterns, daytime brain fog, disruptive to GI friendly bacteria and suppresses 
immune function. This leads to increased risks for depression, insulin 
resistance, hypothyroidism and high stress can further exacerbate virtually all 
health challenges.  
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
The Personality Connection 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
The connection between blood type and personality has long been studied. In an 
independent study, Dr. D'Adamo found that most Blood Type B's often described 
themselves in ways related to the following characteristics: subjective, 
easygoing, creative, original and flexible. In another study, Type B's scored 
significantly higher on "intuiting," indicating a preference or sixth sense 
information; and they scored high on the "intuiting/feeling" combination, 
indicating that they tend to be insightful, mystical, idealistic, creative, 
globally-oriented, people-oriented and good at imagining. They also reported 
that they learned best through listening, then reflecting on and interpreting 
what they had observed. Perhaps the nomadic life of the steppes contributed to 
long hours given over to talk as well as ample time for meditation and 
reflection.

<p>
  Type B's will not be very good in competitive sports, such as basketball,
  football, soccer, they won't have that "in your bones" fanatical interest in
  them, even as spectators.
