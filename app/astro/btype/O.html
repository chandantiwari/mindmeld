<h3>O</h3>
<p> 
   
Type O was the first blood type, the type O ancestral prototype was a canny, 
aggressive predator. Aspects of the Type O profile remain essential in every 
society even to this day - leadership, extroversion, energy and focus are among 
their best traits. Type O's can be powerful and productive, however, when 
stressed Type O's response can be one of anger, hyperactivity, and 
impulsivity. When Type O wiring gets crossed, as a result of a poor diet, lack 
of exercise, unhealthy behaviors or elevated stress levels, Type O's are more 
vulnerable to negative metabolic effects, including insulin resistance, sluggish 
thyroid activity, and weight gain.

What Makes You Unique

Type O's have a higher level of stomach acid than the other blood types, which 
often results in stomach irritation and ulcers. Dr. D'Adamo recommends a 
licorice preparation called DGL (de glycyrrhizinated licorice) which can reduce 
discomfort and aid healing. DGL protects the stomach lining in addition to 
protecting it from stomach acids. Avoid crude licorice preparations as they 
contain a component of the plant which can cause elevated blood pressure. This 
component has been removed in DGL. Dr. D'Adamo also recommends Mastic Gum and 
Bismuth to soothe Type O's common and even frequent tummy troubles.

Type O Personality? 
 
<br/>   
<br/>   
   
In an independent study of 45 MBA students, Type O's most often described 
themselves in ways related to the following characteristics; responsible, 
decisive, organized, objective, rule-conscious, and practical. Both male and 
female Type O's reported a higher percentage of the mesomorphic body type when 
compared to controls. Interestingly, Type O's also scored significantly higher 
than the rest in "sensing" - using the 5 senses to gather information, and in 
the sensing-thinking combination, indicating that they are more detail and fact 
oriented, logical, precise and orderly. "I believe that the tendency to sense 
and get facts right stems from the inbred hunter-gatherer need to observe and 
accurately assess the environment in order to insure survival." Says D'Adamo.

Manage Your Type O Stress 
 
<br/>   
<br/>   
   
The legacy of your Type O ancestry causes an immediate "fight or flight" 
response in people of this blood type. However, this finely tuned response to 
stress, so vital in early Type O's, is not always so beneficial in modern 
times. The Type O response can cause bouts of excessive anger, temper tantrums, 
hyperactivity and even create a severe enough chemical imbalance to bring about 
a manic episode. Since there is a powerful, synergistic relationship between the 
release of dopamine and feelings of reward, Type O is more vulnerable to 
destructive behaviors when overly tired, depressed or bored. These can include 
gambling, sensation seeking, risk taking, substance abuse and impulsivity. To 
avoid becoming overstressed, Dr. D'Adamo recommends following the Type O diet, 
which focuses on lean, organic meats, vegetables and fruits and avoid wheat and 
dairy which can be triggers for digestive and health issues in Type 
O. Additionally, he suggests that Type O's avoid caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine 
can be particularly harmful because of its tendency to raise adrenaline and 
noradrenaline, which are already high for Type O's.

Energize - The Essential Exercise Component 
 
<br/>   
<br/>   
   
Type O's benefit tremendously from brisk regular exercise that taxes the 
cardiovascular and muscular skeletal system. But the benefit derived surpasses 
the goal of physical fitness. Type O also derives the benefit of a well timed 
chemical release system. The act of physical exercise releases a swarm of 
neurotransmitter activity that acts as a tonic for the entire system. The Type O 
who exercises regularly also has a better emotional response. You are more 
emotionally balanced as a result of well regulated, efficient chemical transport 
system. More than any other blood type, O's rely on physical exercise to 
maintain physical health and emotional balance. Dr. D'Adamo suggests that Type 
O's engage in regular physical activity three to four times per week. For best 
results, engage in aerobic activity for thirty to forty five minutes at least 
four times per week. If you are easily bored, choose two or three different 
exercises and vary your routine.

In addition to exercising and eating foods that are Right For Your Type, here 
are a few key lifestyle strategies for Type O individuals: 
 
<br/>   
<br/>   
   
    * Develop clear plans for goals and tasks - annual, monthly, weekly, daily to avoid impulsivity. 
<br/>   
    * Make lifestyle changes gradually, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. 
<br/>   
    * Eat all meals, even snacks, seated at a table. 
<br/>   
    * Chew slowly and put your fork down between bites of food. 
<br/>   
    * Avoid making big decisions or spending money when stressed. 
<br/>   
    * Do something physical when you feel anxious. 
<br/>   
    * Engage in thirty to forty five minutes of aerobic exercise at least four times per week. 
<br/>   
    * When you crave a pleasure releasing-substance (alcohol, tobacco, sugar), do something physical.
