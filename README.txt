Birthday:sign database is the pocketbudda.dat file. This file is
generated by processing / combining lewi.dat and other lookups. Other
lookups are Chinese and Spiller signs which use src/scripts/chinese,
spiller files. Millman sign is calculated on-the-fly, at runtime for
each birtdate.

lewi.dat file is generated using jlewi project on github.

The Python appspot files are under the app folder. In order to run the
site, you start dev server using this folder. localhost:8080 will
connect to the main site, localhost:8080/mobile will connect to the
mobile site. Android code directly connects to this site.

Training MB Statistical Method

* Names of celebs whose MB types are known are in
  myer-briggs.txt. generate_celeb_mbti.py look these names up in celebs and
  celeb_life_goal, and creates a combined mb-celeb-astro.txt. Then we run
  train_mb_celeb.py. 
  
  Or just look at / run mbti.sh
  
  
TODO
-----

The part of the code that can determine the MBTI type based on
birthdate works statistically, using sample data. There could be
another way; by simply looking all birthday related attributes -such
as Lewi, Spiller, etc-, maybe we can determine someone's MBTI type
directly. For example take Millman 30/3: This type implies a certain
unease or indifference to emotions, can that be taken as a signal Fi
or Fe will definitely be at a lower level (3rd, or 4th). Or the
presence of Lewi 194 would mean Ti/Te will not be dominant??

Imagine such a push & pull being done for each type, finally landing
someone to an MBTI type. This calculation would base itself on
"nature rather than nurture" view obviously, so depending on the
correctness of that argument, its findings would succeed or fail. 

If it is true however, there'd be some prepatory  work necessary,
someone had to decide which attributes effects which MBTI functions.
