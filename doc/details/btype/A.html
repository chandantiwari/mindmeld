<h3>A</h3>
<p> 
The key factor in the development of Type A can be traced to the struggle for 
survival long ago, when there was a rapidly dwindling supply of hunting game 
stock. Having exhausted the great game herds of Africa, humans pushed farther 
out from their ancestral home into Europe and Asia. The cultivation of grains 
and livestock changed everything. For the first time, people were able to forego 
the hand to mouth lifestyle of the hunter/gatherer and establish stable 
communities. Over time the adaptations that produced Blood Type A were based on 
the need to fully utilize nutrients from carbohydrate sources.

What Makes Type A Unique 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
Many neurochemical factors in the Type A genetic disposition favor a structured, 
rhythmic, harmonious life, surrounded by a positive, supportive community. The 
harried pace and increased sense of isolation experienced by so many in today's 
society often make these needs difficult to achieve. Type A best exemplifies the 
powerful interconnections between mind and body.

Type A Diet 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
It is important for sensitive Type As to eat their foods in as natural a state 
as possible: pure, fresh and organic. "I can't emphasize enough how this 
critical dietary adjustment can be to the sensitive immune system of Type 
A. With this diet you can supercharge your immune system and potentially short 
circuit the development of life threatening diseases."

Handling Stress 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
Dr. D'Adamo recommends that you limit sugar, caffeine and alcohol. Don't skip 
meals, especially breakfast; eating smaller, more frequent meals will also help 
to stabilize blood sugar levels. He also points out that the following factors 
are known to increase cortisol levels and increase mental exhaustion for Type As 
- be aware and limit your exposure when possible: 
 
    * Crowds of people 
    * Loud noise 
    * Negative emotions 
    * Smoking 
    * Strong smells or perfumes 
    * Too much sugar and starch 
    * Overwork 
    * Violent TV and movies 
    * Lack of sleep 
    * Extreme weather conditions (hot or cold)

The Personality Connection 
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
Type As most often described themselves in ways related to the following
characteristics: sensitive to the needs of others, good listeners, detail
oriented, analytical, creative and inventive. Type A's will not be very good in
competitive sports, such as basketball, football, soccer, they won't have the
"in your bones" fanatical interest in them, even as spectators. This does not
mean other kinds of sports, or an interest in martial arts, weight lifting is
not possible.
