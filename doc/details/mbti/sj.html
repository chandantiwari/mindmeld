can become highly skilled in logistics. Thus their most practiced and developed
intelligent operations are often supervising and inspecting (SJT adminstering),
or supplying and protecting (SJF conserving). And they would if they could be
magistrates watching over these forms of social facilitation. They are proud of
themselves in the degree they are reliable in action, respect themselves in the
degree they do good deeds, and feel confident of themselves in the degree they
are respectable. In search of security as they are the "Security Seeking
Personality"-trusting in legitimacy and hungering for membership. They are
usually stoical about the present, pessimistic about the future, fatalistic
about the past, and their preferred time and place is the past and the
gateway. Educationally they go for commerce, avocationally for regulations, and
vocationally for materiel work. They tend to be enculturating as parents,
helpmates as spouses, and conformity oriented as children. There are even more
Guardians than Artisans around, at least 40% and as many as 45% of the
population.
