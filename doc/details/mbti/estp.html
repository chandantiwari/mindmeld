<h3>ESTP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/estp.html

<br/>
<br/>

ESTPs are spontaneous, active folks. Like the other SPs, ESTPs get great
satisfaction from acting on their impulses. Activities involving great power,
speed, thrill and risk are attractive to the ESTP. Chronic stifling of these
impulses makes the ESTP feel "dead inside."

<br/>
<br/>

Gamesmanship is the calling card of the ESTP. Persons of this type have a
natural drive to best the competition. Some of the most successful salespersons
are ESTPs. P.T. Barnum ("Never give a sucker an even break") illustrates the
unscrupulous contingent of this type.

<br/>
<br/>

Almost unconsciously the ESTP looks for nonverbal, nearly subliminal cues as to
what makes her quarry "tick." Once she knows, she waits for just the right time
to trump the unsuspecting victim's ace and glory in her conquest. Oddly enough,
the ESTP seems to admire and respect anyone who can beat her at her own game.

<br/>
<br/>

"If I was any better, I couldn't stand it!" To an ESTP, admission of weakness
feels like failure. He admires strength in himself and in others.

<br/>
<br/>

"Shock effect" is a favored technique of this type to get the attention of his
audience. ESTPs love to be at center stage, demonstrating feats of wonder and
daring.

Functional Analysis:

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

These are the ultimate realists. Extraverted Sensors are at one with objects and
experiences now, in the only living, pulsing moment that ever really exists. The
Sensor is compelled to see, touch, taste, smell and feel all that moves, wafts,
tingles, tinkles, scintillates, vibrates or resonates. Some ESTPs are keenly
discriminating; only those elements of singular quality and experience will
suffice. Others revel in earthiness. If baseness can elicit shock from more
squeamish observers, so much the better.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

Even a consummate Sensor needs to decide which hand to grasp the gusto with;
Introverted Thinking is her preferred yardstick. Introverted, and auxiliary to
Sensing, the T function maintains a low profile, keeps its opinions mainly to
itself, and readily yields to allow Sensing to savor a special moment. The ESTP
preference for mental, physical and emotional toughness surely can be traced to
this detached, rational function.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

Though only a minor character, Feeling plays an important role in a favorite
pastime of ESTPs. This is not to say that ESTPs don't care deeply for others,
yet Feeling is such a ready hand-puppet, expedient in disarming the "victim" and
exposing the jugular. Sincere Feeling is tertiary and thus relatively simplistic
in this type. As such, it can be the undoing of ESTPs at the hands of those they
(perhaps unconsciously) come to trust.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

In the inferior (fourth) position, intuition may be virtually absent much of the
time. Haziness of inner, symbolic vision is the psychic price of the clarity of
sensory awareness. As do other SPs, ESTPs reserve a certain "gut" sense of
timing and luck. When repression and stress empower the Shadow, it likely finds
expression through intuition in stereotypic perceptions of groups and
individuals whom it perceives and hostile or hurtful.

<br/>

The Doer

<br/>
<br/>

As an ESTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take
things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary
mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTPs are outgoing, straight-shooting types. Enthusiastic and excitable, ESTPs
are "doers" who live in the world of action. Blunt, straight-forward
risk-takers, they are willing to plunge right into things and get their hands
dirty. They live in the here-and-now, and place little importance on
introspection or theory. The look at the facts of a situation, quickly decide
what should be done, execute the action, and move on to the next thing.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTPs have an uncanny ability to perceive people's attitudes and
motivations. They pick up on little cues which go completely unnoticed by most
other types, such as facial expressions and stance. They're typically a couple
of steps ahead of the person they're interacting with. ESTPs use this ability to
get what they want out of a situation. Rules and laws are seen as guidelines for
behavior, rather than mandates. If the ESTP has decided that something needs to
be done, then their "do it and get on with it" attitude takes precendence over
the rules. However, the ESTP tends to have their own strong belief in what's
right and what's wrong, and will doggedly stick to their principles. The Rules
of the Establishment may hold little value to the ESTP, but their own integrity
mandates that they will not under any circumstances do something which they feel
to be wrong.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTPs have a strong flair for drama and style. They're fast-moving, fast-talking
people who have an appreciation for the finer things in life. They may be
gamblers or spendthrifts. They're usually very good at story telling and
improvising. They typically makes things up as they go along, rather than
following a plan. They love to have fun, and are fun people to be around. They
can sometimes be hurtful to others without being aware of it, as they generally
do not know and may not care about the effect their words have on others. It's
not that they don't care about people, it's that their decision-making process
does not involve taking people's feelings into account. They make decisions
based on facts and logic.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTP's least developed area is their intuitive side. They are impatient with
theory, and see little use for it in their quest to "get things done". An ESTP
will occasionally have strong intuitions which are often way off-base, but
sometimes very lucid and positive. The ESTP does not trust their instincts, and
is suspicious of other people's intuition as well.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESTP often has trouble in school, especially higher education which moves
into realms where theory is more important. The ESTP gets bored with classes in
which they feel they gain no useful material which can be used to get things
done. The ESTP may be brilliantly intelligent, but school will be a difficult
chore for them.

<br/>
<br/>

The ESTP needs to keep moving, and so does well in careers where he or she is
not restricted or confined. ESTPs make extremely good salespersons. They will
become stifled and unhappy dealing with routine chores. ESTPs have a natural
abundance of energy and enthusiasm, which makes them natural entrepreneurs. They
get very excited about things, and have the ability to motivate others to
excitement and action. The can sell anyone on any idea. They are
action-oriented, and make decisions quickly. All-in-all, they have extraordinary
talents for getting things started. They are not usually so good at following
through, and might leave those tasks to others. Mastering the art of following
through is something which ESTPs should pay special attention to.

<br/>
<br/>

ESTPs are practical, observant, fun-loving, spontaneous risk-takers with an
excellent ability to quickly improvise an innovative solution to a
problem. They're enthusiastic and fun to be with, and are great motivators. If
an ESTP recognizes their real talents and operates within those realms, they can
accomplish truly exciting things.

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ESTPs as Promoters, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Artisan. ESTPs account for about 4-10% of the
population.

<br/>
<br/>

* E - Extraversion preferred to introversion: ESTPs often feel motivated by
  their interaction with people. They tend to enjoy a wide circle of
  acquaintances, and they gain energy in social situations (whereas introverts
  expend energy).[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ESTPs tend to be more concrete than
  abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than the big
  picture, and on immediate realities rather than future possibilities .[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* T - Thinking preferred to feeling: ESTPs tend to rely on objective criteria
  rather than personal values. When making decisions, they generally give more
  weight to logic than to social considerations.[8]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* P - Perception preferred to judgment: ESTPs tend to withhold judgment and
  delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should
  circumstances change.[9]

Myers-Briggs description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Myers-Briggs, ESTPs are hands-on learners who live in the moment,
seeking the best in life, wanting to share it with their friends. The ESTP is
open to situations, able to improvise to bring about desired results. They are
active people who want to solve their problems rather than simply discuss them.

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Keirsey, ESTPs, or "Promoter Artisans", are the most adept among
the types at influencing other people. Promoting is the art of maneuvering
others to one's position. Concrete in speech and utilitarian in action, they are
smooth operators. The ESTP knows everyone who matters and everything there is to
do because they are very resourceful, always knowing where the fun and action
is. They like to indulge themselves in the finer things in life and to bring
other people with them. Their goal in life is to sell themselves and their ideas
to others. Dramatic and debonair, they are gifted at earning others' confidence.
