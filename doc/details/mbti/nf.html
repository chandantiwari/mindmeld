<h3>Idealist</h3>

Idealists, being abstract in communicating and cooperative in implementing
goals, can become highly skilled in diplomatic integration. Thus their most
practiced and developed intelligent operations are usually teaching and
counseling (NFJ mentoring), or conferring and tutoring (NFP advocating). And
they would if they could be sages in one of these forms of social
development. The Idealist temperament have an instinct for interpersonal
integration, learn ethics with ever increasing zeal, sometimes become diplomatic
leaders, and often speak interpretively and metaphorically of the abstract world
of their imagination.

They are proud of themselves in the degree they are empathic in action, respect
themselves in the degree they are benevolent, and feel confident of themselves
in the degree they are authentic. Idealist types search for their unique
identity, hunger for deep and meaningful relationships, wish for a little
romance each day, trust their intuitive feelings implicitly, aspire for
profundity. This is the "Identity Seeking Personality"-credulous about the
future, mystical about the past, and their preferred time and place are the
future and the pathway. Educationally they go for the humanities, avocationally
for ethics, and vocationally for personnel work.

Social relationships: In their family interactions they strive for mutuality,
provide spiritual intimacy for the mates, opportunity for fantasy for their
children, and for themselves continuous self-renewal. Idealists do not abound,
being as few as 8% and nor more than 10% of the population.
