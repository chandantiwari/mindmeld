f<h3>ISFJ</h3>

http://typelogic.com/isfj.html

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs are characterized above all by their desire to serve others, their "need
to be needed." In extreme cases, this need is so strong that standard
give-and-take relationships are deeply unsatisfying to them; however, most ISFJs
find more than enough with which to occupy themselves within the framework of a
normal life. (Since ISFJs, like all SJs, are very much bound by the prevailing
social conventions, their form of "service" is likely to exclude any elements of
moral or political controversy; they specialize in the local, the personal, and
the practical.)

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs are often unappreciated, at work, home, and play. Ironically, because they
prove over and over that they can be relied on for their loyalty and unstinting,
high-quality work, those around them often take them for granted--even take
advantage of them. Admittedly, the problem is sometimes aggravated by the ISFJs
themselves; for instance, they are notoriously bad at delegating ("If you want
it done right, do it yourself"). And although they're hurt by being treated like
doormats, they are often unwilling to toot their own horns about their
accomplishments because they feel that although they deserve more credit than
they're getting, it's somehow wrong to want any sort of reward for doing work
(which is supposed to be a virtue in itself). (And as low-profile Is, their
actions don't call attention to themselves as with charismatic Es.) Because of
all of this, ISFJs are often overworked, and as a result may suffer from
psychosomatic illnesses.

<br/>
<br/>

In the workplace, ISFJs are methodical and accurate workers, often with very
good memories and unexpected analytic abilities; they are also good with people
in small-group or one-on-one situations because of their patient and genuinely
sympathetic approach to dealing with others. ISFJs make pleasant and reliable
co-workers and exemplary employees, but tend to be harried and uncomfortable in
supervisory roles. They are capable of forming strong loyalties, but these are
personal rather than institutional loyalties; if someone they've bonded with in
this way leaves the company, the ISFJ will leave with them, if given the
option. Traditional careers for an ISFJ include: teaching, social work, most
religious work, nursing, medicine (general practice only), clerical and and
secretarial work of any kind, and some kinds of administrative careers.

<br/>
<br/>

While their work ethic is high on the ISFJ priority list, their families are the
centers of their lives. ISFJs are extremely warm and demonstrative within the
family circle--and often possessive of their loved ones, as well. When these
include Es who want to socialize with the rest of the world, or self-contained
ITs, the ISFJ must learn to adjust to these behaviors and not interpret them as
rejection. Being SJs, they place a strong emphasis on conventional behavior
(although, unlike STJs, they are usually as concerned with being "nice" as with
strict propriety); if any of their nearest and dearest depart from the
straight-and-narrow, it causes the ISFJ major embarrassment: the closer the
relationship and the more public the act, the more intense the embarrassment (a
fact which many of their teenage children take gleeful advantage of). Over time,
however, ISFJs usually mellow, and learn to regard the culprits as harmless
eccentrics :-). Needless to say, ISFJs take infinite trouble over meals, gifts,
celebrations, etc., for their loved ones--although strong Js may tend to focus
more on what the recipient should want rather than what they do want.

<br/>
<br/>

Like most Is, ISFJs have a few, close friends. They are extremely loyal to
these, and are ready to provide emotional and practical support at a moment's
notice. (However, like most Fs they hate confrontation; if you get into a fight,
don't expect them to jump in after you. You can count on them, however, run and
get the nearest authority figure.) Unlike with EPs, the older the friendship is,
the more an ISFJ will value it. One ISFJ trait that is easily misunderstood by
those who haven't known them long is that they are often unable to either hide
or articulate any distress they may be feeling. For instance, an ISFJ child may
be reproved for "sulking," the actual cause of which is a combination of
physical illness plus misguided "good manners." An adult ISFJ may drive a (later
ashamed) friend or SO into a fit of temper over the ISFJ's unexplained
moodiness, only afterwards to explain about a death in the family they "didn't
want to burden anyone with." Those close to ISFJs should learn to watch for the
warning signs in these situations and take the initiative themselves to uncover
the problem.

Functional Analysis

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

As for ISTJs, the dominant Si is oriented toward the world of forms, essences,
generics. Again, "for both of the IS_J types, the sense of propriety comes from
the clear definition of these internal forms. ... A 'proper' chair has four
legs," etc. (Jung saw IS as something of an oxymoron: sensing, which is a
perceiving function, focused inward and thus away from that which is perceived
(the "object"). In this light, he described this sensing as something removed
from reality, full of archetypes/mythical figures/hobgoblins; sensing of one's
own set of forms.)

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

A kind of "regression toward the mean" provided by the Fe auxiliary function
serves to socialize the expression of these forms. I suppose it's the auxiliary
nature of this Feeling, coupled with the balancing effect of {detachment from
the internal idiosyncratic view of free-floating data perceptions} that makes
ISFJs tentative, conservative, and reticent to boldly state the rights and
wrongs in the relational world. (Loosely translated, ISFJs like to keep their
perceptions to themselves, and aren't sure enough that what they "see" as
Introverted Sensors has any relevance to the outside world. Thus the perception,
based on unworldly data, may not be true. The obedient Extraverted Feeling
function must therefore refrain from strong statements expressing these
opinions.)

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking is turned inward and is largely invisible. It is only with
great difficulty, if at all, that the ISFJ could willingly commit anyone to
their doom. Perhaps this explains why ISFJs are loyal to the end; there is no
sense of purely objective (i.e., impersonal) judgement of anyone but themselves
(and that only by their own standards). Here is this type's achilles heel that
makes many of them so vulnerable to

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs are easily undone by Extraverted iNtuition, their inferior
function. Believing in the fantastic, and disbelieving the technologically
extant, are errors that my guide the gullible (or unfoundedly sceptical) ISFJ
off a precipice of mis-conclusion. (One of our co-workers' mothers adamantly
refused to believe that Dave Letterman's mom was actually at the olympics in
Norway talking with the athletes and handing out hams! She suspected
technological trickery.)

<br/>
<br/>

This childlike Ne is, however, the likely source (coupled with fun-loving
Extraverted Feeling) of the practical joking, punning and (usually harmless)
impishness of some ISFJs.

The Nurturer

<br/>
<br/>

As an ISFJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you takes
things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary
mode is external, where you deal with things according to how you feel about
them, or how they fit into your personal value system.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs live in a world that is concrete and kind. They are truly warm and
kind-hearted, and want to believe the best of people. They value harmony and
cooperation, and are likely to be very sensitive to other people's
feelings. People value the ISFJ for their consideration and awareness, and their
ability to bring out the best in others by their firm desire to believe the
best.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs have a rich inner world that is not usually obvious to observers. They
constantly take in information about people and situations that is personally
important to them, and store it away. This tremendous store of information is
usually startlingly accurate, because the ISFJ has an exceptional memory about
things that are important to their value systems. It would not be uncommon for
the ISFJ to remember a particular facial expression or conversation in precise
detail years after the event occured, if the situation made an impression on the
ISFJ.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs have a very clear idea of the way things should be, which they strive to
attain. They value security and kindness, and respect traditions and laws. They
tend to believe that existing systems are there because they work. Therefore,
they're not likely to buy into doing things in a new way, unless they're shown
in a concrete way why its better than the established method.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs learn best by doing, rather than by reading about something in a book, or
applying theory. For this reason, they are not likely to be found in fields
which require a lot of conceptual analysis or theory. They value practical
application. Traditional methods of higher education, which require a lot of
theorizing and abstraction, are likely to be a chore for the ISFJ. The ISFJ
learns a task best by being shown its practical application. Once the task is
learned, and its practical importance is understood, the ISFJ will faithfully
and tirelessly carry through the task to completion. The ISFJ is extremely
dependable.

<br/>
<br/>

The ISFJ has an extremely well-developed sense of space, function, and aesthetic
appeal. For that reason, they're likely to have beautifully furnished,
functional homes. They make extremely good interior decorators. This special
ability, combined with their sensitivity to other's feelings and desires, makes
them very likely to be great gift-givers - finding the right gift which will be
truly appreciated by the recipient.

<br/>
<br/>

More so than other types, ISFJs are extremely aware of their own internal
feelings, as well as other people's feelings. They do not usually express their
own feelings, keeping things inside. If they are negative feelings, they may
build up inside the ISFJ until they turn into firm judgments against individuals
which are difficult to unseed, once set. Many ISFJs learn to express themselves,
and find outlets for their powerful emotions.

<br/>
<br/>

Just as the ISFJ is not likely to express their feelings, they are also not
likely to let on that they know how others are feeling. However, they will speak
up when they feel another individual really needs help, and in such cases they
can truly help others become aware of their feelings.

<br/>
<br/>

The ISFJ feels a strong sense of responsibility and duty. They take their
responsibilities very seriously, and can be counted on to follow through. For
this reason, people naturally tend to rely on them. The ISFJ has a difficult
time saying "no" when asked to do something, and may become over-burdened. In
such cases, the ISFJ does not usually express their difficulties to others,
because they intensely dislike conflict, and because they tend to place other
people's needs over their own. The ISFJ needs to learn to identify, value, and
express their own needs, if they wish to avoid becoming over-worked and taken
for granted.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs need positive feedback from others. In the absence of positive feedback,
or in the face of criticism, the ISFJ gets discouraged, and may even become
depressed. When down on themselves or under great stress, the ISFJ begins to
imagine all of the things that might go critically wrong in their life. They
have strong feelings of inadequacy, and become convinced that "everything is all
wrong", or "I can't do anything right".

<br/>
<br/>

The ISFJ is warm, generous, and dependable. They have many special gifts to
offer, in their sensitivity to others, and their strong ability to keep things
running smoothly. They need to remember to not be overly critical of themselves,
and to give themselves some of the warmth and love which they freely dispense to
others.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISFJ

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ISFJs as Protectors, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Guardians.[2] ISFJs account for about 9-14% of the
population.

<br/>
<br/>

* I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: ISFJs tend to be quiet and
  reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather
  than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social
  situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ISFJs tend to be more concrete than
  abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than the big
  picture, and on immediate realities rather than future possibilities.[8]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* F - Feeling preferred to thinking: ISFJs tend to value personal considerations
  above objective criteria. When making decisions, they often give more weight
  to social implications than to logic.[9]
  
<br/>
<br/>

* J - Judgment preferred to perception: ISFJs tend to plan their activities and
  make decisions early. They derive a sense of control through
  predictability.[10]

Myers-Briggs description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Myers-Briggs, ISFJs are interested in maintaining order and harmony
in every aspect of their lives. They are steadfast and meticulous in handling
their responsibilities. Although quiet, they are people-oriented and very
observant. Not only do they remember details about others, but they observe and
respect others’ feelings. Friends and family are likely to describe them as
thoughtful and trustworthy.

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Keirsey, ISFJs, or "Protector Guardians", are most concerned with
taking care of people by keeping them safe and secure. They are modest
caretakers who do not demand credit or thanks for their efforts. But while they
are essentially compassionate-and in fact exercise more patience in dealing with
the disabled than perhaps any other type-their shyness with strangers can lead
others to misread them as standoffish. Only among friends and family may this
quiet type feel comfortable speaking freely. ISFJs are serious people with a
strong work ethic, not inclined to self-indulgence. They believe in being
meticulous and thrifty. They work well alone. While they may enjoy taking care
of others, they do not enjoy giving orders.
