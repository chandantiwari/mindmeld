<h3>INTP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/intp.html

<br/><br/>

INTPs are pensive, analytical folks. They may venture so deeply into thought as
to seem detached, and often actually are oblivious to the world around them. 

<br/><br/>

Precise about their descriptions, INTPs will often correct others (or be sorely
tempted to) if the shade of meaning is a bit off. While annoying to the less
concise, this fine discrimination ability gives INTPs so inclined a natural
advantage as, for example, grammarians and linguists.

<br/><br/>

INTPs are relatively easy-going and amenable to almost anything until their
principles are violated, about which they may become outspoken and
inflexible. They prefer to return, however, to a reserved albeit benign
ambiance, not wishing to make spectacles of themselves.

<br/><br/>

A major concern for INTPs is the haunting sense of impending failure. They spend
considerable time second-guessing themselves. The open-endedness (from
Perceiving) conjoined with the need for competence (NT) is expressed in a sense
that one's conclusion may well be met by an equally plausible alternative
solution, and that, after all, one may very well have overlooked some critical
bit of data. An INTP arguing a point may very well be trying to convince himself
as much as his opposition. In this way INTPs are markedly different from INTJs,
who are much more confident in their competence and willing to act on their
convictions.

<br/><br/>

Mathematics is a system where many INTPs love to play, similarly languages,
computer systems--potentially any complex system. INTPs thrive on
systems. Understanding, exploring, mastering, and manipulating systems can
overtake the INTP's conscious thought. This fascination for logical wholes and
their inner workings is often expressed in a detachment from the environment, a
concentration where time is forgotten and extraneous stimuli are held at
bay. Accomplishing a task or goal with this knowledge is secondary.

<br/><br/>

INTPs and Logic -- One of the tipoffs that a person is an INTP is her obsession
with logical correctness. Errors are not often due to poor logic -- apparent
faux pas in reasoning are usually a result of overlooking details or of
incorrect context.

<br/><br/>

Games NTs seem to especially enjoy include Risk, Bridge, Stratego, Chess, Go,
and word games of all sorts. (I have an ENTP friend that loves Boggle and its
variations. We've been known to sit in public places and pick a word off a menu
or mayonnaise jar to see who can make the most words from its letters on a
napkin in two minutes.) The INTP mailing list has enjoyed a round of Metaphore,
virtual volleyball, and a few 'finish the series' brain teasers.

<br/><br/>

Introverted Thinking

<br/><br/>

Introverted Thinking strives to extract the essence of the Idea from various
externals that express it. In the extreme, this conceptual essence wants no form
or substance to verify its reality. Knowing the Truth is enough for INTPs; the
knowledge that this truth can (or could) be demonstrated is sufficient to
satisfy the knower. "Cogito, ergo sum" expresses this prime directive quite
succinctly.

<br/><br/>

In seasons of low energy level, or moments of single-minded concentration, the
INTP is aloof and detached in a way that might even offend more relational or
extraverted individuals.

<br/><br/>

Extraverted iNtuition

<br/><br/>

Intuition softens and socializes Thinking, fleshing out the brittle bones of
truths formed in the dominant inner world. That which is is not negotiable; yet
actual application diffuses knowledge to the extent that knowledge needs
qualification and context to be of any consequence in this foreign world of
substance.

<br/><br/>

If Thinking can desist, the INTP is free to brainstorm, calling up the
perceptions of the unconscious (i.e., intuition) which are mirrored in patterns
in the realm of matter, time and space. These perceptions, in the form of
theories or hunches, must ultimately defer to the inner principles, or at least
they must not negate them.

<br/><br/>

Intuition unchained gives birth to play. INTPs enjoy games, formal or impromptu,
which coax analogies, patterns and theories from the unseen into spontaneous
expression in a way that defies their own comprehension.

<br/><br/>

Introverted Sensing

<br/><br/>

Sensing is of a subjective, inner nature similar to that of the SJs. It supplies
awareness of the forms of senses rather than the raw, analogic stimuli. Facts
and figures seek to be cleaned up for comparison with an ever growing range of
previously experienced input. Sensing assists intuition in sorting out and
arranging information into the building blocks for Thinking's elaborate systems.

<br/><br/>

The internalizing nature of the INTP's Sensing function leaves a relative
absence of environmental awareness (i.e., Extraverted Sensing), except when the
environment is the current focus. Consciousness of such conditions is at best a
sometime thing.

<br/><br/>

Extraverted Feeling

<br/><br/>

Feeling tends to be all or none. When present, the INTP's concern for others is
intense, albeit naive. In a crisis, this feeling judgement is often silenced by
the emergence of Thinking, who rushes in to avert chaos and destruction. In the
absence of a clear principle, however, INTPs have been known to defer judgement
and to allow decisions about interpersonal matters to be left hanging lest
someone be offended or somehow injured. INTPs are at risk of being swept away by
the shadow in the form of their own strong emotional impulses.

<br/><br/>


http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html

<br/><br/>

As an INTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal
with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you
take things in primarily via your intuition.

<br/><br/>

INTPs live in the world of theoretical possibilities. They see everything in
terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. They live
primarily inside their own minds, having the ability to analyze difficult
problems, identify patterns, and come up with logical explanations. They seek
clarity in everything, and are therefore driven to build knowledge. They are the
"absent-minded professors", who highly value intelligence and the ability to
apply logic to theories to find solutions. They typically are so strongly driven
to turn problems into logical explanations, that they live much of their lives
within their own heads, and may not place as much importance or value on the
external world. Their natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding
may turn into a feeling of personal responsibility to solve theoretical
problems, and help society move towards a higher understanding.

INTPs value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to
generate new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They approach
problems and theories with enthusiasm and skepticism, ignoring existing rules
and opinions and defining their own approach to the resolution. They seek
patterns and logical explanations for anything that interests them. They're
usually extremely bright, and able to be objectively critical in their
analysis. They love new ideas, and become very excited over abstractions and
theories. They love to discuss these concepts with others. They may seem
"dreamy" and distant to others, because they spend a lot of time inside their
minds musing over theories. They hate to work on routine things - they would
much prefer to build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation
of the system to others. They are intensely interested in theory, and will put
forth tremendous amounts of time and energy into finding a solution to a problem
with has piqued their interest.

<br/><br/>

INTPs do not like to lead or control people. They're very tolerant and flexible
in most situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been violated or
challenged, in which case they may take a very rigid stance. The INTP is likely
to be very shy when it comes to meeting new people. On the other hand, the INTP
is very self-confident and gregarious around people they know well, or when
discussing theories which they fully understand.

<br/><br/>

The INTP has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of
personal subjectivity or feelings. They strive constantly to achieve logical
conclusions to problems, and don't understand the importance or relevance of
applying subjective emotional considerations to decisions. For this reason,
INTPs are usually not in-tune with how people are feeling, and are not naturally
well-equiped to meet the emotional needs of others.

<br/><br/>

The INTP may have a problem with self-aggrandizement and social rebellion, which
will interfere with their creative potential. Since their Feeling side is their
least developed trait, the INTP may have difficulty giving the warmth and
support that is sometimes necessary in intimate relationships. If the INTP
doesn't realize the value of attending to other people's feelings, he or she may
become overly critical and sarcastic with others. If the INTP is not able to
find a place for themself which supports the use of their strongest abilities,
they may become generally negative and cynical. If the INTP has not developed
their Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware of their environment,
and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type tasks, such as bill-paying
and dressing appropriately.

<br/><br/>

For the INTP, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed
correctly and succinctly. They are likely to express themselves in what they
believe to be absolute truths. Sometimes, their well thought-out understanding
of an idea is not easily understandable by others, but the INTP is not naturally
likely to tailor the truth so as to explain it in an understandable way to
others. The INTP may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it
out, moving on to the next thing. It's important that the INTP place importance
on expressing their developed theories in understandable ways. In the end, an
amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person who understands it.

<br/><br/>

The INTP is usually very independent, unconventional, and original. They are not
likely to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity and
security. They usually have complex characters, and may tend to be restless and
temperamental. They are strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought
patterns which allows them to analyze ideas in new ways. Consequently, a lot of
scientific breakthroughs in the world have been made by the INTP.

<br/><br/>

The INTP is at his best when he can work on his theories independently. When
given an environment which supports his creative genius and possible
eccentricity, the INTP can accomplish truly remarkable things. These are the
pioneers of new thoughts in our society.

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/><br/>

Dominant: Introverted Thinking
<br/><br/>

Auxiliary: Extraverted Intuition
<br/><br/>

Tertiary: Introverted Sensing
<br/><br/>

Inferior: Extraverted Feeling

<br/><br/>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP

<br/><br/>

Keirsey referred to INTPs as Architects, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Rationals. INTPs are one of the rarest types,
accounting for about 1-5% of the population.

<br/><br/>

I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: INTPs tend to be quiet and
reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather than
a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social situations
(whereas extraverts gain energy).
      
<br/><br/>

N - iNtuition preferred to sensing: INTPs tend to be more abstract than
concrete. They focus their attention on the big picture rather than the details,
and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities.[8]
      
<br/><br/>

T - Thinking preferred to feeling: INTPs tend to value objective criteria
above personal preference. When making decisions, they generally give more
weight to logic than to social considerations.[9]
      
<br/><br/>

P - Perception preferred to judgment: INTPs tend to withhold judgment and
delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should
circumstances change.[10]
      

<br/><br/>

INTPs are quiet, thoughtful, analytical individuals who tend to spend long
periods of time on their own, working through problems and forming
solutions. They are curious about systems and how things work. Consequently,
they are frequently found in careers such as science, architecture, and
law. INTPs tend to be less at ease in social situations or in the "caring
professions," although they enjoy the company of those who share their
interests. They prize autonomy in themselves and others. They generally balk at
attempts by others to convince them to change. They also tend to be impatient
with the bureaucracy, rigid hierarchies, and the politics prevalent in many
professions. INTPs have little regard for titles and badges, which they often
consider to be unjustified. INTPs usually come to distrust authority as
hindering the uptake of novel ideas and the search for knowledge. INTPs accept
ideas based on merit, rather than tradition or authority. They have little
patience for social customs that seem illogical or that serve as obstacles for
pursuing ideas and knowledge. This may place them at odds with people who have
an SJ preference, since SJs tend to defer to authority, tradition, and what the
rest of the group is doing.[2] INTPs prefer to work informally with others as
equals.[11] 

<br/><br/>

INTPs organize their understanding of any topic by articulating principles, and
they are especially drawn to theoretical constructs. Having articulated these
principles for themselves, they can demonstrate remarkable skill in explaining
complex ideas to others in simple terms, especially in writing. On the other
hand, their ability to grasp complexity may also lead them to provide overly
detailed explanations of simple ideas, and listeners may judge that the INTP
makes things more difficult than they need to be. To the INTPs' mind, they are
presenting all the relevant information or trying to crystallize the concept as
clearly as possible.[11] 

<br/><br/>

Given their independent nature, INTPs may prefer working alone to leading or
following in a group. During interactions with others, if INTPs are focused on
gathering information, they may seem oblivious, aloof, or even rebellious-when
in fact they are concentrating on listening and understanding. However, INTPs'
extraverted intuition often gives them a quick wit, especially with
language. They may defuse tension through comical observations and
references. They can be charming, even in their quiet reserve, and are sometimes
surprised by the high esteem in which their friends and colleagues hold
them.[11]

<br/><br/>

INTPs are driven to fully understand a discussion from all relevant
angles. Their impatience with seemingly indefensible ideas can make them
particularly devastating at debate.[2] When INTPs feel insulted, they may
respond with sudden, cutting criticism. After such an incident, INTPs are likely
to be as bewildered as the recipient. They have broken the rules of debate and
exposed their raw emotions. To INTPs, this is the crux of the problem:
improperly handled emotions, INTPs believe, can only harm. While INTPs
experience emotions as an important part of their internal lives, and sometimes
share their emotions with others, INTPs nevertheless believe that emotions must
not play a role in logical discussions, or be expressed in a way that would put
themselves at disadvantage.

<br/><br/>

Dominant: Introverted thinking (Ti)

<br/><br/>

Ti seeks precision, such as the exact word to express an idea. It notices the
minute distinctions that define the essence of things, then analyzes and
classifies them. Ti examines all sides of an issue, looking to solve problems
while minimizing effort and risk. It uses models to root out logical
inconsistency.[12] Ti is calm, articulate, and aware of the forces that bind
reality together. As introverted Thinkers, INTPs spend the majority of their
time and energy ordering the interior, logical world of principles and
generalizations in an effort to understand.  [edit] Auxiliary: Extraverted
intuition (Ne)

<br/><br/>

Ne finds and interprets hidden meanings, using -Y´what if¡ questions to
explore alternatives, allowing multiple possibilities to coexist. This
imaginative play weaves together insights and experiences from various sources
to form a new whole, which can then become a catalyst to action.[13] Ne gives
INTPs a grasp of the patterns of the world around them. They use their intuition
to amalgamate empirical data into coherent pictures, from which they can derive
universal principles. INTPs frequently puzzle over a problem for hours on end,
until the answer suddenly crystallizes in a flash of insight.  [edit] Tertiary:
Introverted sensing (Si)

<br/><br/>

Si collects data in the present moment and compares it with past experiences, a
process that sometimes evokes the feelings associated with memory, as if the
subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect what is familiar, Si draws upon
history to form goals and expectations about what will happen in the future.[14]
Si gives INTPs the potential for keen observation. They use this function to
gather empirical data, use physical tools, perceive physical relationships, and
support their internal logic with a rich sense of space.  [edit] Inferior:
Extraverted feeling (Fe)

<br/><br/>

Fe seeks social connections and creates harmonious interactions through polite,
considerate, and appropriate behavior. Fe responds to the explicit (and
implicit) wants of others, and may even create an internal conflict between the
subject’s own needs and the desire to meet the needs of others.[15] Fe drives
the INTP to desire harmony in community. At their most relaxed, INTPs can be
charming and outgoing among friends, or when they have a clearly defined role in
the group. When under stress, however, INTPs can feel disconnected from the
people around them, unable to use their extraverted Feeling to reach out to
others. As their inferior function, Feeling can be a weak point; when threatened
they will hide behind a wall of stoic logic. This can lead them to bottle up
their emotions to preserve reason and harmony; but a failure to deal with these
concealed emotions can lead to inappropriate outbursts.

<br/><br/>

      
Type dynamics of the INTP    

<br/><br/>

As a practical example of Type Dynamics, consider the two types known as the
introverted thinkers (ISTP and INTP). They share dominant introverted thinking,
which gives them a solid interior grasp of underlying principles. The ISTPs,
with their preference for extraverted sensing, love understanding physical,
mechanical systems. The INTPs, with their extraverted intuition, love
understanding theoretical systems. ISTPs are often quite skilled in using
whatever materials are at hand in their building projects, using available tools
to their full capabilities to serve their goals, through their extraverted
sensing. INTPs, like their Sensing cousins, love using the right tool for the
right job, but they also consult their intuition to solve problems. They are
particularly comfortable with "virtual" tools, reflecting their love of
technology.[citation needed]

<br/><br/>

With a knack for improvisation, the INTP can cause no end of frustration to
ESTJs and ISTJs. These types generally cannot make the same intuitive leaps that
come naturally to the INTP. On the other hand, they are quick to note (sometimes
smugly) when the INTP must stop in the middle of a project to puzzle over the
previously discarded instructions, which the STJs read at the start.[11]


<br/><br/>

http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/myers-briggs/intp.htm


<br/><br/>

INTPs direct their energy towards the inner world of thoughts and emotions. They structure and organise their ideas, coming up with theories and explanations to explain new areas of scientific research or experience. They often seek to understand the full complexity of any situation and enjoy solving difficult intellectual problems.
What makes an INTP tick?

<br/><br/>

The Dominant function is the judging one of Thinking. Characteristics
associated with this function include:

<br/><br/>

* Likes making decisions on the basis of logic, using objective considerations
<br/>
* Is concerned with truth, principles and justice
<br/>
* Is analytical and critical, tending to see the flaws in situations
<br/>
* Takes an objective approach 
<br/>
<br/>

The judging Thinking function is introverted. That is, Thinking is used
primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The INTP will
therefore:

<br/><br/>

* spend time thinking analytically, organising thoughts on a logical basis
<br/>
* develop an understanding of the principles involved in a situation
<br/>
* spontaneously feel critical of a person or situation, but not necessarily express that criticism
<br/>
* be inwardly decisive, but not communicate those decisions to others
<br/>
* think mostly about impersonal issues, focusing more on concepts, truths and systems rather than individuals' feelings 

<br/><br/>

The Thinking function is primarily supported by extraverted iNtuitive perception. That is, iNtuitive perception is used primarily to manage the outer world of actions and spoken words. This will modify the way that the Thinking is directed, by:

<br/><br/>

* focusing the (inner world) Thinking on understanding possibilities for the future
<br/>
* perceiving patterns in information to support the logical analysis 

<br/><br/>

The classic temperament of an INTP is Promethean, or Phlegmatic, for whom a basic driving force is the search for competence or excellence.
Contributions to the team of an INTP

<br/><br/>

In a team environment, the INTP can contribute by:

<br/>
<br/>

* using analytical and critical skills to solve problems
<br/>
* focusing attention on the central issue
<br/>
* providing intellectual insight
<br/>
* suggesting ideas that achieve long and short term aims
<br/>
* viewing information objectively 
<br/>

The potential ways in which an INTP can irritate others include:

* being too intellectual
<br/>
* finding too many flaws, and not accepting imperfect but 'good enough' solutions
<br/>
* not taking account of others' feelings
<br/>
* suggesting ideas and then appearing to change his/her mind
<br/>
* leave others to worry about implementation once the major problems have been solved
<br/>
* clinging to a principle at the expense of relationships and harmony 

<br/>
<br/>

Personal Growth
<br/>
<br/>

As with all types, the INTP can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as:

<br/>
<br/>
* expressing appreciation towards others
<br/>
* working within other people's limitations
<br/>
* accepting and praising others' imperfect efforts, if they are 'good enough'
<br/>
* consulting others more, and involving them in decisions, to engender ownership
of the solution
<br/>
* spending time to develop personal relationships for their own sake
<br/>
* learning to acknowledge and develop the INTP's own emotions and personal values 

<br/>
<br/>
Recognising Stress

<br/>
<br/>
As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style,
so the INTP will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For
example, in a crisis, the INTP might:

<br/>
<br/>
* withdraw to think about the central issue that needs attention
<br/>
* suggest various ideas, and use the feedback received to support the
intellectual analysis
<br/>
* debate the issue from an intellectual point of view, and leave it very late
before making a decision
<br/>
* criticise others efforts and ignore their feelings 
<br/>
<br/>
Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the INTP's shadow may appear - a
negative form of ESFJ. Example characteristics are:
<br/>
<br/>
* expressing intense negative emotions towards others
<br/>
* being very sensitive to criticism
<br/>
* becoming preoccupied with details, without any logical basis
<br/>
* interpreting facts or events in a very subjective way 

<br/>
<br/>
The shadow is part of the unconscious that is often visible to others, onto whom
the shadow is projected. The INTP may therefore readily see these faults in
others without recognising it in him/her self.

<br/>
<br/>

From Minh Tan Compilation

<br/>
<br/>

The Architect prides themselves on their objectivity and ability to impartially
analyze and organize thoughts. They enjoy tough critiques that help them to hone
the exactitude of their thoughts. What they don’t like is strong emotional
expression directed at them and being denied the alone time that they need. If
this goes on too long, they become highly stressed and may emphasize their
logical thinking to the extreme. They become overly sensitive to relationships
with others and can lash out emotionally. To achieve their normal state again,
they need to be left alone and not asked about their feelings. They also need
reduced responsibilities until they recover.

<br/>
<br/>

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INTP_rel.html

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs live rich worlds inside their minds, which are full of imagination and
excitement. Consequently, they sometimes find the external world pales in
comparison. This may result in a lack of motivation to form and maintain
relationships. INTPs are not likely to have a very large circle of significant
relationships in their lives. They're much more likely to have a few very close
relationships, which they hold in great esteem and with great affection. Since
the INTP's primary focus and attention is turned inwards, aimed towards seeking
clarity from abstract ideas, they are not naturally tuned into others' emotional
feelings and needs. They tend to be difficult to get to know well, and hold back
parts of themselves until the other person has proven themselves "worthy" of
hearing the INTP's thoughts. Holding Knowledge and Brain Power above all else in
importance, the INTP will choose to be around people who they consider to be
intelligent. Once the INTP has committed themself to a relationship, they tend
to be very faithful and loyal, and form affectionate attachments which are pure
and straight-forward. The INTP has no interest or understanding of game-playing
with regards to relationships. However, if something happens which the INTP
considers irreconciliable, they will leave the relationship and not look back.

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs approach their intimate relationships quite seriously - as they approach
most things in life. They take their vows and commitments seriously, and are
usually faithful and loyal. They are usually pretty easy to live with and be
around, because they have simple daily needs and are not overly demanding of
their partners in almost any respect. While the INTP's internal life is highly
theoretical and complex, their external life in comparison is usually quite
simple. They like to keep the complexities of their external world to a minimum,
so that they can focus their brain power on working through their theories
internally. This makes them very straight-forward, honest lovers, with a love
that is quite pure in its simple, uncomplicated nature. 

<br/>
<br/>

Although they choose to keep things straight-forward in their relationships,
this does not mean that the INTP is lacking in depth of feeling or passion. The
INTP is very creative person, who has vivid imaginations. They can be very
excitable and passionate about their love relationships. Sometimes, they have a
problem reconciling the exciting visions of their internal worlds with the
actuality of their external circumstances.

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs do not like to deal with messy complications, such as interpersonal
conflict, and so they may fall into the habit of ignoring conflict when it
occurs. If they feel they must face the conflict, they're likely to approach it
from an analytical perspective. This may aggravate the conflict situation, if
their partner simply wants to feel that they are supported and loved. Most
people (and especially those with the Feeling preference) simply want to be
encouraged, affirmed and supported when they are upset. The INTP should practice
meeting these needs in conflict situations.

<br/>
<br/>

INTP's natural partner is the ENTJ, or the ESTJ. The INTP's dominant function of
Introverted Thinking is best matched with a partner whose personality is
dominated by Extraverted Thinking. The INTP/ENTJ match is ideal, because these
types shared Intuition as a common way of perceiving the world, but INTP/ESTJ is
also a good match.

Designer Theorizer: INTP

<br/>
<br/>

Relationship

<br/>
<br/>

The last minute planner is often found in the INTP. They are in such a
rush to discover and feel everything that they are in a constant state
of planning. The idea of changing on a dime is never a problem for the
INTP. 

<br/>
<br/>

In love relationships, patience is key in dealing with the INTP. They
are always ready to explore the deepest reaches of love and commitment
but can also reverse course with alarming speed. What is often seen,
as a lack of caring is really just the inability to plan. 

<br/>
<br/>

The family is a great tool for the INTP to explore who they are. They
will often do the entire family root discovering in an effort to find
out more information and gain more knowledge about the base of their
family and ultimately themselves. 
Career

<br/>
<br/>

The INTP needs to find a challenge. They love to problem solve. If
they ever find themselves in a situation that doesn't challenge them,
they will grow discontented and depressed. Listlessness is their
greatest pain. Other popular INTP career directions include: Strategic
Planning, Writer, Lawyer, Computer Programmer. 

<br/>
<br/>

Education

<br/>
<br/>

The INTP has many interests and due to this broad range often find
school difficult due to the need for focus. Often where it was tough
to get through grade school, the INTP will thrive in the college
environment.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs are extremely analytical types who are naturally drawn to
solving intellectual problems. They tend to be original thinkers who
develop real expertise in their chosen field. 

<br/>
<br/>

INTPS predominantly use intuition in their external world. This leads
them to be big picture, conceptual thinkers who are drawn to the
abstract and the theoretical. They take great pleasure in discussing
ideas with other people - particularly those who share their
intellectual approach.  
<br/>
<br/>


INTPs' first preference is for thinking which they use to run their
interior thought processes. Their intuition comes up with new
information and then their thinking sets about finding new ways to
analyse it. Unlike some of the other thinking types, INTPs do not use
their thinking to try to control other people or run their outer
life. 

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs are able to hold many complex thoughts in their head but they
often find it difficult to do justice to the complexity of this in
speech. When this happens they can feel frustrated. They may then turn
to writing as it offers them a better way to convey the sophistication
of their thoughts.  

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs are very sceptical and take nothing at face value. Indeed they
tend to have a very scientific attitude to life, seeing nothing as the
truth but simply as the best starting point for analysis. They are
often attracted to philosophy, science or social sciences and to
academic life in general.  

INTPs' intellectual and sceptical approach often leads them to be the
most questioning of all the types. They often feel driven to clarify
and detest sloppy thinking or inconsistencies. In discussion this
leads them to readily point out the flaws or illogicalities in others'
thinking. They will often contradict other people or try to engage
them in debate on precise definition of terms and concepts.  

Truth and honesty are vitally important to INTPs and they need to feel
they are acting in congruence with their principles. It is also
difficult for INTPs to respect anyone who they do not perceive as
operating with intellectual or personal integrity. INTPs do not have a
great need to discuss their principles with others. They discuss ideas
readily yet much of their thinking is never conveyed to other people. 
<br/>
<br/>


INTPs value their independence greatly and expect others to
reciprocate. This means that relationships can sometimes be a
difficult area for them to achieve the balance between autonomy and
sharing which they often desire.  
<br/>
<br/>


Despite their natural reticence in relationships INTPs often make
great networkers. They will get to know and maintain relationships
with people who they think are interesting or who may have access to
information which may be useful to them or their colleagues.  
<br/>
<br/>


INTPs sometimes find it difficult to finish things unless they have a
deadline. They like variety and need room for manoeuvre. Like all NPs,
INTPs struggle with organisation and don't often pay enough attention
to practical details. They can find it easy to mislay things and
generally find it hard to keep order and control in their outer
lives. This is in contrast to the structure of the inner world.  

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs, like their fellow type ISTPs, may be prone to outbursts of
anger. Outwardly they may appear laid back people but in their head
their thinking is leading them to make continual evaluations and
judgments. However, as introverts, INTPs don't tend to tell other
people these thoughts until they have stepped over an invisible
line. The INTPs' annoyance then boils over and they get angry. To
other people this seems to happen out of the blue and it can be a
source of friction in their relationships both at work and at home. 

<br/>
<br/>

Relationships with others, particularly paying attention to people's
feelings can be hard for INTPs. Others can resent what they see as
INTPs' desire to split hairs or indulge in intellectual
competition. But INTPs often believe their verbal challenges are a
sincere and genuine attempt to help the person improve their
thinking. 

<br/>
<br/>

Female INTPs often learn to curb these impulses to challenge others'
views, as they are more aware of how it can be damaging to others but
male INTPs can find this a harder lesson to learn. Female INTPS often
learn earlier that relationships are important and need to be
nurtured. 

<br/>
<br/>

Ultimately it is important for INTPs to manage their anger
better. They can do this by learning to be more assertive and
expressing their growing displeasure at an earlier stage.  It is also
helpful for them to begin to pay more attention to the importance of
feelings - their own and others. Time management skills can also prove
useful.

Common relationship Issues for INTPs

<br/>
<br/>
INTPs show caring by listening to others and challenging their
thoughts processes to ensure logic and rationality. 

<br/>
<br/>
INTPs like others to take their ideas seriously and to be prepared to 
debate them at length.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

Like prominent scholars and theorists such as Jung and Einstein, you
have the ability to single-mindedly pursue your goals and move around
obstacles while avoiding distractions that would derail most people.
Absorbed by the inner world of thoughts and ideas, you use your
rational ability coolly, objectively and impersonally.  Your family
and friends most likely tend to describe you as creative and ingenious
yet also understated and a bit shy.

<br/>
<br/>

Your greatest personal strength lies in your ability to patiently and
thoroughly work out the fundamental principles of a system, an
operation or a problem.  In fact, you happily tend to lose yourself in
thought.  You do not need encouragement or support from others to
continue your work.  Indeed, it is not essential that others even
understand or appreciate what you do for you to function.  You are an
independent thinker, content in a world unto yourself. 

<br/>
<br/>

Overall the INTPs tend to have very accommodating and flexible
personalities.  Moving from one intuitive understanding to another is
usually effortless for you.  Deep in thought, your first interest is
mostly on solving puzzles.  Before you will communicate and contribute
your thoughts, you want to make sure you have them clearly organised
internally first.  As a result, you can sometimes be seen as reserved
and withdrawn.  In fact, you may even tend to regard others as a
disturbance to your intense thinking process.  That is because your
focus is to pay more attention to the realm of logic and principles
than situations or people. 

<br/>
<br/>

An INTP may also have difficulty communicating ideas effectively.
Conversations can quickly turn into articulating the exactness of the
tiniest pieces of the entire puzzle.  Before you know it, the answer
to a question can be so precise and complicated that few can follow
the discussion.  But an INTP certainly appreciates those who have the
patience and attentiveness to keep up with the dialogue. 

<br/>
<br/>

If you are called upon to share information or instruct others,
however, remember to be organised, keep the ideas simple and use
common language instead of jargon.  As a result, your presentations
and communications will become more successful.  Also, do not hesitate
to ask for feedback from your friends and colleagues, even in casual
conversation, and then use that feedback to enhance your communication
style. 

<br/>
<br/>

Intimate relationships can sometimes pose a dilemma for
Introverting-Thinking types, simply because of the feelings involved.
You do not intend to be coarse or unkind-sometimes you are simply
inattentive to the significance of the Feeling dimension.  So intent
are you on the content of a conversation, that you may not be aware of
another's feelings or how your behaviour affects others.  You might
let feelings affect your own attitudes and behaviour so little that it
may be difficult to convince you about anything except through reason
and logic. 

<br/>
<br/>

On the other hand, you and other INTPs do have feelings and you do
relate to people.  But the Feeling dimension is not your first
preference-Thinking is.  It could take more awareness and practice on
your part to become more aware of the important part your feelings and
those of others play in communication and relationships. 

<br/>
<br/>

Introverts overall tend to invest time, caring and affection in only a
few people, gauging friendships by depth and endurance, rather than by
breadth and quantity.  As an Introvert, carefree external
demonstrations of feeling do not mean that much to you.  "Still waters
run deep" characterises best your view of friendships and
relationships.  As a result, you tend to not need liberal and open
reciprocation of your feelings, nor do you require lots of active
contact to sustain a relationship.  When a friend is in need, you will
be there - this year, next year, ten years from now.  You have the
ability to form a kind of quiet, intense and devoted friendship. 

<br/>
<br/>
Although only a small segment of the population falls into your
personality category, if you only counted the number of faculty
teaching at distinguished colleges and universities, you would think
the world was abundant with INTPs.  Wherever you find an body of
individuals whose distinguishing characteristics are imagination,
originality, perceptive acumen, creativity and a delight in tackling
the complex, you will find a number of kindred souls.  You are perhaps
the most intellectually profound of all the Types.  Thinking, combined
with Intuition, gives you greater insight than Thinking alone and
provides you with intellectual curiosity, speed in understanding,
ingenuity and a wealth of ideas for dealing with problems.  However,
these same qualities also make it more difficult for you to deal with
repetitive tasks or mundane facts and realities.

<br/>
<br/>

Continually living on the edge of logical plausibilities and
potentials, you delight in abstract projects and are excited by the
unknown.  As long as your expansive mind and intellect are not
swallowed up by mind-numbing day-to-day routines, you can succeed in
any occupation.  Internally, you want order, but consistent order
might not be present in your external world.  Instead, you tend to go
through cycles of being organised and then disorganised.   

<br/>
<br/>

Intuitive, Introverted Thinkers like yourself often find themselves caught in the 
"absentminded professor's" syndrome in everyday life.

<br/>
<br/>
You are an individual in love with learning and are fascinated by the
very concept of intelligence.  You, and those like you, share an inner
drive toward performance and a highly self-critical nature that allows
you to continually strive for self-improvement.  Always setting higher
standards, you maintain a "mental list" of things you ought to learn,
accomplish and master. 

<br/>
<br/>

The times when you feel twinges of inadequacy are the times you
measure your worth, and the worth of others, solely by the yardstick
of achievements and accomplishments.  If work is important enough, you
can become a perfectionist and lose sight of when a project is "good
enough."  This is due to your tendency to set your personal standards
so impossibly high.  If you become discouraged or are under a lot of
stress, it is easy for you to make self-judgements and label yourself
as incompetent.  It may be difficult for you to break this cycle of
negative thinking.

<br/>
<br/>

Your Introverted nature seeks peace to work most comfortably.
Whatever the job, you will spend time thinking before acting.  Given
the choice, you prefer a working environment that is quiet and where
you can easily work alone.  You would be content if the telephone
never rang and no one ever intruded or interrupted your train of
thought.

<br/>
<br/>
For you, working long hours on a project without a break is not
bothersome.  You take pride and interest in your job, especially if
you keep in touch with the ideas behind your assignments.  Your
Perceptive qualities allow you to handle great diversity in work and
it is easy for you to shift from one assignment or technique to
another. 

<br/>
<br/>

It is this Perceptive side that allows you to be open and tolerant of
changing situations and tasks requiring repeated revisions.  However,
this open style of working could find you initiating too many
revisions, additions, changes and alterations when they are
unnecessary.  Besides the danger of continually revising or changing
material unasked, there is the twin danger of beginning projects that
you never finish-because they are always changing!  As a result, many
of these activities you have launched wind up in a file, first
delayed, then forgotten. 

<br/>
<br/>

Your Intuiting nature has you continually scanning the horizon for any
future possibilities or potentials within a situation, rather than
staring down at the ground beneath you.  As a result, you can easily
be recognised as an explorer or visionary.  New ideas and theories
fascinate you, and you enthusiastically tackle new problems no matter
how complex.  During these times, you have an unnerving ability to
gather vast stores of patience and energy to devote toward solving the
problem.  However, driven to understand, predict and explain reality,
you may slip into a favourite pattern for those with your personality
- living in a world of ideas, trying to figure out what everything
around you means and, thereby, missing out on directly experiencing
much of life.

<br/>
<br/>

An INTP will find fulfilment when developing ideas, concepts and
principles and typically make great contributions to a chosen field.
You are a person who appreciates intelligence, continually seeks to
increase knowledge and sees possibilities beyond what is present,
known or obvious. 

<br/>
<br/>

It would also be wise, however, to surround yourself with people who
view the world with their Sensing qualities.  Since Sensing types
focus so strongly on the concrete world and direct experience, and
always keep track of the smallest facts and details, you will probably
find their counsel and feedback useful.  Since Intuiting people
usually prefer the company of other Intuitives, you may find this
uncomfortable.  Yet an Intuitive person with a Sensing partner is more
likely to achieve success than the Intuitive alone since their skills
are complimentary. 

<br/>
<br/>

Watch out when circumstances find you working at a job that makes
little use of your Intuiting qualities.  Even worse, avoid occupations
requiring you to only gather, count and manage facts, figures, widgets
or gadgets - activities requiring you to use your lesser developed
Sensing side.  You would be better off turning your sights to tasks
requiring you to view the big picture and bold concepts, not minutia.

<br/><br/>

If, and when, you find that job, employer, or body of co-workers who
can appreciate your style and qualities, you will be valued for your
creative intellect and the imaginative gems you provide to the world
of everyday work.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

While sometimes presenting as aloof or self-focused, INTPs often
attract potential mates through their Extraverted Intuition (Ne) and
Extraverted Feeling (Fe). These functions contribute to their
wittiness, personability, and sincerity, conferring a childlike
innocence that others find refreshing. INTPs are often kind and
considerate, wanting everyone to feel included and treated with
respect (Fe). They are slow to speak negatively of others, able to
forgive and forget what other types might find offensive. Such
qualities, combined with their intelligence and ambitiousness, can be
of great appeal to prospective partners.

<br/><br/>

Should INTPs Even Bother with Relationships?

<br/><br/>

Because of their Fe inferior, INTPs can enjoy being around
people. Even if not directly engaging with them, they can feel
enlivened by the background presence of others (assuming they are not
perceived as obnoxious or intrusive). However, because of their
dominant function’s penchant for inner control and autonomy (Ti),
INTPs can be leery of making Fe commitments, which carry the potential
to shackle their independence.

<br/><br/>

INTP RelationshipsThe fact that INTPs can enjoy working independently
for long periods of time may also discourage them from complicating
their lives with relationships. Despite this relative independence,
there invariably comes a time when their inferior function (Fe)
beckons them to be around people. This may involve feelings of
emptiness or loneliness, alerting them to the fact that their
independent projects may, in and of themselves, be insufficient for
achieving the deeper sense of wholeness and contentment they
desire. This tug-of-war between their Ti and Fe is a central and
recurrent dilemma for INTPs. At some level, INTPs feel like they need
people and want an intimate relationship, while on another, they are
afraid of losing themselves and their cherished freedom if they
commit. 

<br/><br/>

In many cases, INTPs' fears are justified. Most partners are reluctant
to grant them the degree of freedom and autonomy they desire, leading
them to try to control the INTP. This of course, prompts the INTP to
rebel, which causes the relationship to take a turn for the worse. But
because Fe is a legitimate part of INTPs' functional stack, we should
not be too quick to dismiss the potential value of intimate
relationships for INTPs. As the final function in their stack,
understanding and integrating their Fe is critical to their
self-actualization. With that said, sustainable and satisfying
romantic relationships can be hard to come by for INTPs, requiring
that both they and their partners bring significant wisdom and
maturity to the relationship. For this reason, among others, most
INTPs are better off abstaining from any long-term commitments until
later in their development.

<br/><br/>

http://personalityjunkie.com/08/intj-vs-intp-type-differences/

<br/><br/>

Despite having no functions in common, INTJs and INTPs often arrive at
surprisingly similar worldviews. Since both types seek an
understanding of themselves and the world, they can enjoy extensive
discussions and find common ground on any number of topics. Whatever
their similarities, INTJs and INTPs also differ in some important
ways. 

<br/><br/>

Outwardly, distinguishing INTJs from INTPs is generally not all that
difficult. Since INTJs extravert their Thinking (Te), an outsider
quickly encounters their rational nature. INTJs are articulate,
measured, and direct in their speech. They see themselves as strong
debaters and are undeterred in challenging those making dubious
assertions about truth. It pains them to allow untruth to go
unchallenged.

<br/><br/>

INTPs, on the other hand, extravert Intuition (Ne) and Feeling
(Fe). These functions allow INTPs to blend more easily into social
situations. Assuming they are not overly awkward or anxious, they may,
at least initially, remain relatively undistinguished from other
types. Because their Fe is inferior, INTPs tend to be far less
comfortable directly challenging others' assertions. INTPs are more
selective when it comes to asserting their own views or displaying
their rational side. They are disposed to posing questions or positing
possibilities (Ne) rather than making strong assertions (Fe) in
intellectual discussions.

<br/><br/>

[For INTJs] since their dominant function, Introverted Intuition (Ni),
is a Perceiving function, INTJs are, first and foremost, geared to
perceive information. As with INFJs, INTJs' inferior Se unconsciously
apprehends information about the outside world which their Ni then
synthesizes into an "impression." Ni gives INTJs a hunch about what is
happening, whether good or bad, and can work at both broad and local
levels. Broadly, Ni may give INTJs a sense of what is happening in the
big picture of the world. Locally, it might provide insight for
solving an immediate problem. The same is true for INFJs.

<br/><br/>

Since both Ni and Te work convergently, INTJs are natural problem
solvers. This is why they make excellent troubleshooters, consultants,
analysts, mathematicians, physicians, scientists, and engineers.  This
is one way they differ from INTPs. INTPs can readily generate ideas or
possible ways of addressing a problem a la Ti-Ne, but they are less
apt to come to a firm conclusion about what is happening or what
should be done. If someone wants a firm opinion or direct advice about
a complex issue, they are far more likely to get it from an INTJ than
from an INTP. This can make INTJs a better fit for the working world,
since people tend to want firm answers rather than a litany of
options.

<br/><br/>

Despite their knack for problem solving, INTJs may struggle to find
their niche in the world because of their strong idealism and
perfectionism. Some INTJs don't just want to solve any problem, but
the problems that have the biggest impact on the world at large. This
is not necessarily a bad thing. If there is a personality type that
can see the big picture and zero-in on its most pressing issues, it is
probably the INTJ. An INTJ friend of mine is always talking about
"leverage points." His goal is to identify the key leverage points in
the system, issues that he feels are the most foundational and play
the largest role in the world's problems. Their interests in such big
picture issues may lead some INTJs to abstain from more ordinary
career roles and function instead as outside analysts. 

<br/><br/>

Once INTJs do discern what they see as key insights or leverage
points, they may, at least for a time, function as advocates,
activists, or reformers. They may write about their insights, try to
connect with and inform influential people, or even form interest
groups or non-profit organizations. They may continue in such a role
until they encounter what they see as insurmountable resistance or
until they conclude there is likely a better way to effect
change. INTJs' drive to understand and change the world is exemplified
in the life and work of my INTJ friend, Howard Ditkoff, who details
his research, theories, and life experiences on his "systems thinker"
website.

<br/><br/>

[For INTPs], since their dominant Judging function is directed
inwardly (Ti), INTPs tend to be more interested in understanding
themselves and finding wisdom than they are in directly changing the
world. As is true for many INFPs, the self-its structure, nature,
health, and identity-is a constant reference point for INTPs. While
INTJs may display some of this because of their Introversion and their
tertiary Fi, it is typically to a lesser degree. Since Te comes before
Fi in their functional stack, INTJs are, wittingly or not, generally
willing to sacrifice some degree of self-understanding (Fi) for the
sake of working to improve the world (Te). This would be far more
unusual for INTPs, who first priority is finding wisdom and
self-knowledge.

<br/><br/>

Interestingly, I think this may explain where the notion of INTPs
being interested in knowledge "for its own sake" originated. Since
INTPs use their knowledge inwardly (Ti), others are largely blinded to
the process, thereby leading them to assume the INTP a mere "idea
hedonists." But the fact is that INTPs do apply their knowledge, only
they apply it primarily to understanding themselves, to finding their
rightful place in the world, and to their quest for wise and optimal
living. So the notion that INTPs are leisurely and aimlessly consuming
ideas for mere pleasure completely misses the mark (In fact, this
would probably be truer of INJs, whose dominant function is a
Perceiving function.). Since Ti is a Judging function, INTPs tend to
be quite intentional about what they do. This is why, for instance,
they are insistent on efficiency and can be quite miserly about how
their time is being used.

<br/><br/>

With this in mind, we can see how INTJs and INTPs work in different
directions. INTJs focus in a more direct way on ways the world can be
improved and, in the process, come to better understand themselves
(Fi). INTPs, by contrast, focus first on understanding and improving
themselves (Ti) and, in the process, hope to provide a roadmap for
others to do the same (Fe). The way of the Buddha is in many ways
characteristic of the INTP approach-figure out how to save yourself
first, then help others do the same. In this light, the idea of
grassroots or "bottom-up" change holds particular appeal for INTPs.

<br/><br/>

This is not to say that INTPs ignore what's happening in the outside
world (although they may be somewhat less concerned than INTJs
are). Rather, they analyze it with an eye toward furthering their
understanding themselves (Ti) and the human condition (Fe). Because
INTPs have Fe rather than Te in their functional stack, their Ne is
more drawn to exploring Fe sorts of information. This is why INTPs
share much in common with INFJs (who also use Fe and Ti) and tend to
be most captivated by things like philosophy, psychology, and
religion. The T information INTPs do manage to collect (e.g.,
scientific or historical facts) is generally done in hopes of
furthering their understanding of themselves and human nature.

<br/><br/>

While INTJs can excel in careers involving real-world evaluation and
problem-solving, INTPs prefer work they feel is relevant to their
quest for wisdom and self-knowledge. As explained in my recent post on
the ideation of NP types, INTPs enjoy using Ne to make broad
connection among ideas, an endeavor they find deeply interesting and
meaningful. Again, their goal is not necessarily to solve the world's
problems (although this might occur indirectly), but to clarify
concepts and conceptual relationships in a way that is personally
meaningful and moves them closer to a sense of truth and coherence of
thought. Like INFPs, INTPs enjoy weaving together disparate ideas into
a meaningful synthesis. The primary difference is that INFPs are more
apt to do so in works of art, poetry, music, or fiction, whereas INTPs
dwell primarily in the world of concepts.

<br/><br/>

The INTP is above all a thinker and his inner (private) world is a
place governed by a strong sense of logical structure. Every
experience is to be rigorously analysed, the task of the INTP's mind
is to fit each encountered idea or experience into a larger structure
defined by logic. For here is the central goal of the INTP: to
understand and seek truth. The experience of anything takes a back
seat. The INTP is not interested in experiences themselves but is far
more fascinated by concepts. The drive to understand things that are
not yet understood is a very powerful force in the life of an
INTP. Where the Ti preference is strong, this drive can override the
experiential element so strongly that the INTP will become quickly
bored with anything that he has successfully analysed to the point of
understanding it. Once understood, it has nothing left to offer, once
the satisfaction which comes with achieving the goal of understanding
diminishes. Indeed, most primary interests of an INTP are things which
he cannot fully understand, usually because they are highly complex or
have some exotic, mystical element that does not yield to
analysis. This is the real reason why INTPs are drawn to complexity:
anything simple is too quickly understood and cannot hold the
fascination for long. Similarly, proficiency in any area (which
requires continual practice after understanding) is not such a driving
force as it might be for NTJs, for example. While a judging NT will
often seek to become master of his field, an INTP is satisfied by
analysing it alone. The latter is often more of dabbler with ideas
which leads me on to his second crucial aspect: detachment.

<br/><br/>

The Ti-Ne axis leads to a curious overriding desire to observe from a
detached position, indicating the preference for intuitive perception
with respect to external things. Since accurate analysis needs to
avoid becoming hampered with details or being influenced by the
actions of others, the INTP invariably seeks to withdraw, at least in
spirit, from the situation being considered. This detachment can
sometimes be so marked that he will readily see himself as a neutral
observer having no personal association with that going on around him
(unless forced to become directly involved through an attack on his
principles). The INTP enjoys speculating about how a news item (for
example) might be received by other people or how a point of view
might offend certain types of people and be supported by yet other
types; but to have a point of view of his own rarely seems relevant!
This also indicates that Feeling is his least developed function. The
argument may even be made that "points of view" and "opinions" are
irrelevant since only objective truth counts. In reality, INTPs can
often become far less objective than they think they ought to be:
precisely at those times when the under-developed Feeling gnaws at his
being.

<br/><br/>

Now looking specifically at first the Ti, the principle of detachment
even encompasses how an INTP views himself. He may analyse his own
thought processes as if his mind and body were separate from his
conscious self. In wanting to understand his reactions to things, he
may treat himself, even his own thoughts, as subjects for
experiment. At the extreme end of the scale, where Ti is very
dominant, the ultimate goal of understanding the world with total
clarity must be achieved through total detachment from
everything. Fortunately, Ti never dominates over the other 3
preferences to such an extent that such an unhealthy state is reached.

<br/><br/>

Where detachment ceases is when someone makes an illogical statement
or violates one of the INTPs principles. At such a point, the INTP
feels the instant drive to provide for clarity. This is his Mission;
to be the provider of clarity, and is often suspicious that he is the
only person capable of this task. Here, the INTP risks being seen as
over-critical, aloof and arrogant. On the whole, however, real
arrogance is rare for INTPs for their desire is not to dominate others
but simply to observe, analyse and clarify. Once the point has been
clarified, the INTP withdraws quickly, for he prefers not to be in the
limelight unless absolutely necessary. Hence, for most of the time,
INTPs are easy-going and will fit in to others' needs, taking up the
role of observer again.

<br/><br/>

While proficiency may not be a central goal, competence always is. The
difference here may be subtle, but it is important. If an INTP decides
to learn a skill, then it is very important for him that he reaches a
sufficient level so that basic errors can be avoided. Errors made by
others are to be expected and can be criticised. But errors made by
oneself attack the very root of the person, which is ultimately about
rationality, logic and truth. INTPs hate to think of themselves being
in any way inadequate, at least in areas that are important to
them. So, as soon as he puts himself behind some task, then he must
achieve competency. But that is as far as it goes. Refined competency
requires too much effort and has little attraction. It would require
practice and that usually bores an INTP. Hence, it is common to see
INTPs dabbling at many things, achieving competency, just enough to
prove to themselves that they could become more proficient if they
wished, but rarely actually bothering to refine their skills
further. This is a point at which we begin to get a feel for the
workings of iNtuition backing up Thinking. The INTP has a whole set of
skills which he knows that he would be proficient at, yet other people
may know little of this. He is satisfied with the knowledge that he
has these skills but often sees no requirement to demonstrate this to
others, an indication of the strong Ti nature.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

Quiet, reflective, impersonal, easy-going - but, like other INs, not
amenable to violation of their principles.  Their reserve and desire
for privacy may lead them to be considered unsociable or arrogant, but
such is not the truth.  They enjoy - and need - time to reflect and
process a broad, rich inner tapestry of thoughts and ideas - exploring
these thoughts and ideas and seeing what emerges from them. 
 
<br/><br/>

INTPs are true intellectuals, valuing ideas and receive great
fulfillment from the abstract and the symbolic.  They are visionary
and possess a great ability to concentrate, whether on abstractions,
issues of logic or ideas.   Being analytical is a process of pleasure
and occurs naturally with INTPs. 
 
<br/><br/>

INTPs are deep thinkers who give the impression that they are so
interiorly involved that "the real world" escapes them.  Such is not
necessarily the case but is the perceived result of the process of
amassing massive amounts of information - as INTPs are inordinately
interested in precision:  in thinking and in speaking.  Imprecision
can greatly annoy INTPs who have a propensity for intellectualism and,
being so naturally predisposed, are unaware that others, more likely
than not,  do not have the same level of intellectualism.  What they
can do, they expect others to be able to do.  They do not see others
as weaker in intellect. 

<br/><br/>

This can create problems for they proceed in speaking and doing,
assuming they are understood at the same level that they understand.
Not so. 
 
<br/><br/>

And what they do or desire to do is to master the knowledge of
whatever they are interested in:  mathematics, computers, languages,
systems of thought that require logical thinking. 
 
<br/><br/>

For all their intellectualism, the mastering of systems and analytical
abilities, INTPs are yet insecure, which often is the plight of those
whose gifts are natural and not necessarily learned through academic
study.  Therefore, INTPs spend a good deal of time fearing failure and
attempting to gain more knowledge with which to prevent such failure. 
 
<br/><br/>

As will the INTJs, INTPs will debate points AND fine points.  Both
enjoy learning, but  INTPs are more apt to be arguing in order to
convince themselves that what THEY think is indeed true. 
 
<br/><br/>

INTPs enjoy mental games that grant opportunity to utilize analysis,
contemplation, ideas and concentration.  Chess would be such an
enterprise.  Intellectual pursuits are intriguing and pleasureable. 
 
<br/><br/>

Their tendency to "correct" others' "looseness" in thought, ideation,
grammar, pronunciation, etc., might tend to be off-putting to
co-workers and friends but INTPs are really easy-going and can be
pleasant to be with if one is not threatened by someone with "smarts"
used so naturally and competently.

Primary Axis: Introverted Thinking - Extraverted Intuition

<br/><br/>

The INTP is above all a thinker and his inner (private) world is a
place governed by a strong sense of logical structure. Every
experience is to be rigorously analysed, the task of the INTP's mind
is to fit each encountered idea or experience into a larger structure
defined by logic. For here is the central goal of the INTP: to
understand and seek truth. The experience of anything takes a back
seat. The INTP is not interested in experiences themselves but is far
more fascinated by concepts. The drive to understand things that are
not yet understood is a very powerful force in the life of an
INTP. Where the Ti preference is strong, this drive can override the
experiential element so strongly that the INTP will become quickly
bored with anything that he has successfully analysed to the point of
understanding it. Once understood, it has nothing left to offer, once
the satisfaction which comes with achieving the goal of understanding
diminishes. Indeed, most primary interests of an INTP are things which
he cannot fully understand, usually because they are highly complex or
have some exotic, mystical element that does not yield to
analysis. This is the real reason why INTPs are drawn to complexity:
anything simple is too quickly understood and cannot hold the
fascination for long. Similarly, proficiency in any area (which
requires continual practice after understanding) is not such a driving
force as it might be for NTJs, for example. While a judging NT will
often seek to become master of his field, an INTP is satisfied by
analysing it alone. The latter is often more of dabbler with ideas
which leads me on to his second crucial aspect: detachment.

<br/><br/>

Dominant Function: Introverted Thinking

<br/><br/>

Now looking specifically at first the Ti, the principle of detachment
even encompasses how an INTP views himself. He may analyse his own
thought processes as if his mind and body were separate from his
conscious self. In wanting to understand his reactions to things, he
may treat himself, even his own thoughts, as subjects for
experiment. At the extreme end of the scale, where Ti is very
dominant, the ultimate goal of understanding the world with total
clarity must be achieved through total detachment from
everything. Fortunately, Ti never dominates over the other 3
preferences to such an extent that such an unhealthy state is reached.

<br/><br/>

Where detachment ceases is when someone makes an illogical statement
or violates one of the INTPs principles. At such a point, the INTP
feels the instant drive to provide for clarity. This is his Mission;
to be the provider of clarity, and is often suspicious that he is the
only person capable of this task. Here, the INTP risks being seen as
over-critical, aloof and arrogant. On the whole, however, real
arrogance is rare for INTPs for their desire is not to dominate others
but simply to observe, analyse and clarify. Once the point has been
clarified, the INTP withdraws quickly, for he prefers not to be in the
limelight unless absolutely necessary. Hence, for most of the time,
INTPs are easy-going and will fit in to others' needs, taking up the
role of observer again.

<br/><br/>

While proficiency may not be a central goal, competence always is. The
difference here may be subtle, but it is important. If an INTP decides
to learn a skill, then it is very important for him that he reaches a
sufficient level so that basic errors can be avoided. Errors made by
others are to be expected and can be criticised. But errors made by
oneself attack the very root of the person, which is ultimately about
rationality, logic and truth. INTPs hate to think of themselves being
in any way inadequate, at least in areas that are important to
them. So, as soon as he puts himself behind some task, then he must
achieve competency. But that is as far as it goes. Refined competency
requires too much effort and has little attraction. It would require
practice and that usually bores an INTP. Hence, it is common to see
INTPs dabbling at many things, achieving competency, just enough to
prove to themselves that they could become more proficient if they
wished, but rarely actually bothering to refine their skills
further. This is a point at which we begin to get a feel for the
workings of iNtuition backing up Thinking. The INTP has a whole set of
skills which he knows that he would be proficient at, yet other people
may know little of this. He is satisfied with the knowledge that he
has these skills but often sees no requirement to demonstrate this to
others, an indication of the strong Ti nature.

<br/><br/>

Related to this is the central aspect of independence. INTP's put
great weight on being individuals and essentially different from other
people, who they often view as being too alike and too
interdependent. Independence touches on many aspects. One is the
competency aspect above. When he is interested in something, then the
INTP must be competent in it. But there are many things which don't
interest him, and some of these will be things that others may be very
competent in and where it may be assumed that everyone should be
competent in them. The INTP usually applies the word "irrelevant" to
such things: that is his excuse for any lack of competency in any
field. And if he originally wished to achieve something, but failed,
then it must be because was in fact irrelevant! The opinions of others
are rarely given much weight in themselves. All opinions must get
filtered through an analysis procedure to test for viability. No title
or claim of being an "expert" carries any weight with an INTP. All
people, big or small, are subject to an identical scrutiny. The INTP
sees himself as the independent arbiter, whether a fair claim or
not. However, when someone has proved his credentials through having
sensible opinions, he will be afforded great respect by the INTP. Most
respected of all are those who are not only sensible but also
innovative. Intelligence is above all highly prized.

<br/><br/>

Independence, derived primarily from strongly introverted Thinking,
leads to perhaps the most difficult aspect (for others) of the INTP,
namely stubbornness. If an INTP is pushed into doing something he will
automatically resist. The reason for the resistance is simply that any
action must first be filtered by the Ti, guided by the Ne. He must be
given the chance to reach an independent decision, approving or
rejecting the action. Hence, he must withdraw to allow the analysis
process to work. If withdrawal is not allowed then stubborn resistance
is the inevitable result. However, others may not always find the INTP
excessively stubborn, since the decision-making process can sometimes
be rapidly accelerated when intuition takes the upper hand. The best
way to get an INTP to do something is to suggest the idea as an option
and let him sleep on it. Ultimately, the INTP must always believe that
it is his decision. Once he is satisfied that the decision was
independently reached, then he is content.

<br/><br/>

A further result of the Ti function is the concept, lived out by many
an INTP, that knowledge is everything. They tend to believe that
information is the key to life. All mistakes can be avoided by having
the right information at the right time. This has at least a certain
logic about it. Where they differ from other temperaments (especially
from SP types) is that a large gap may exist between knowing and
doing. To know is everything, to do is a lower order necessity, if it
is necessary at all. This breeds the potential for lazy aloofness. The
INTP is often satisfied simply by knowing that he could do something
if he wished. This also leads to the danger of overestimating one's
capabilities and losing a grip on reality. Here is an aspect where
INTP and ENTP types differ strongly. The latter, with dominant
iNtuition, are much more driven by shaping the world according to
their ideas, ie. thinking supports and subordinates doing. For the
INTP, doing supports and subordinates thinking.

<br/><br/>

Finally, the dominant Ti function means that the INTP takes his
interests and beliefs very seriously. Honesty and directness when
explaining these interests are usually displayed. INTPs detest facades
and particulary dislike people who exhibit them. Equally, those kind
of people also dislike INTPs and avoid them at all cost, for they know
that the INTP will see right through them. The INTP's serious nature
also makes them almost immune to mockery and being made fun of, at
least when face to face with their mocker. If someone attempts to make
a sarcastic, mocking comment about an interest of an INTP, the latter
will defend himself with a pure, almost naive seriousness, explaining
his position with a severe exactness, wielding his words like
swords. This almost always disarms the mocker who does not expect such
a penetrating defence. The INTPs defence usually also contains a
subtle but biting attack thrown back in the mocker's face, chiefly
because the INTP cannot entirely hide the fact that he believes his
opponent to be stupid. Such confrontations might develop rapidly into
physical ones, a danger that the INTP should be aware of. This ability
to wield words with cutting precision is one of the INTP's greatest
assests, but equally one of his most deadly traits. He is capable of
using words creatively to penetrate deep into the understanding of a
subject, but if not checked and wielded carelessly, his words can
become highly destructive, especially where the Feeling function is
heavily suppressed.

<br/><br/>

Secondary Function: Extraverted Intuition

<br/><br/>

Intuition is a mode of perception which focusses on the larger
picture, the connections between objects, on the possibilities rather
than the facts. When this is extraverted (Ne), the act of intuitive
perception grapples with the world itself in order to understand it
and its chief goal is to derive meaning. The INTP is sometimes
referred to as the architect. The world is an object of study and
possibilities for changing and shaping it according to the schemes
assessed by the Ti core are derived from intuition. If his
introversion is strong, however, then his schemes tend to remain
private and speculative: the world remains an intellectual object of
study but his architectural plans may not actually be put into
practice. The constructor/inventor ENTP, on the other hand, with whom
the Ne is dominant, aggressively grapples with and shapes the world,
showing little reticence. The INTP is of the same spirit, but his
constructive nature is likely to take shape within more private
hobbies and less likely to directly involve others.

<br/><br/>

Where the extraversion of the iNtuition function becomes obvious is
during discussions, especially heated ones. In contrast to INTJs, an
INTP will often make controversial, speculative points of argument,
often annoying the discussion-partner, and make them in such a way as
to leave the impression that he is very serious about what he says. In
reality, the INTP is not actually even certain himself whether he
really stands by what he is saying, but his Ne strongly suggests that
there must be a core of truth there. The purpose then of his outspoken
style of argument is to sharpen his own intuitive understanding by
testing the reaction of the listener, and indeed to examine the logic
of his own arguments in real time while speaking them out. On
occasion, INTPs may seem brash and tactless, but for themselves it is
part of their way of getting closer to the truth. This is another
aspect of the Ne grappling with the external world (in this case
discussion with another) to understand it. The Ne provides the raw
material for the Ti core to analyse. The INTJ, on the other hand, with
Ni dominant and Te as secondary, tends to avoid letting uncertain
speculative ideas out in the open: he presents a more considered
structured viewpoint to the world while holding his private thoughts
free for intuitive reasoning. The INTJ resembles a chess player,
ruminating on the possibilites and then making decisive accurate
moves. If the INTP played life as chess, he would keep wishing to
modify the allowed-move-properties of his various pieces to optimise
his strategy, find that that isn't allowed, and ask to start the game
afresh! The ENTP chess player would indeed modify the rules to his
advantage and complain that the standard rules were inadequate! The
ENTJ would play by the standard rules but insist on making the moves
for his opponent as well !

<br/><br/>

Extraverted iNtuition has a strong influence on how the INTP views his
own interaction with others. It is the Ne above all that the INTP most
loves to show others. He is therefore happy to be seen as somewhat
eccentric, innovative and perceptive. In dreaming about what he would
like to become or achieve, his goals are invariably highly
individualistic. He must become the composer, the solo performer, the
genius scientist who makes the unique discovery. If he is to be
noticed at all, then he must be centre stage. If he can't be centre
stage in an area of interest, then he must withdraw and resort to
vitriolic criticism. But in all areas which interest him less he
happily leaves to others and observes. With an INTP it is either all
or nothing. Half-efforts he dislikes just as much as he dislikes the
restrictions of teamwork and co-operation.

<br/><br/>

Humour is another aspect which marks out the INTP. He can readily
dream up jokes about almost any situation. Taking things out of
context is the chief source of humour and many an INTP is a Monty
Pythonite. The Ne is the engine and source of this
joke-generator. Needless to say, the humour of an INTP can be pretty
zany and warped and may not be understood easily by others. The
problem is that the Ne concepts for jokes are put into a structure
only by the Ti. Hence, the humour can become black and tactless,
having felt little Feeling input. Funnily enough, INTPs are dreadful
tellers of jokes (which seems to be more the domain of those with Se),
perhaps because they pay too little attention to detail when speaking
spontaneously. If you see someone smirking and laughing at some
private thought, without any obvious reason, he's probably an
INTP. INTPs may however make good comedy writers, with the humour of
Woody Allen being particularly liked.

<br/><br/>

The preference for intuitive perception means that INTPs dislike
having their lives planned. They feel a distinct unease before most
fixed appointments and cannot fully relax until the scheduled event is
over, or at least in progress. However, the dreaded event is usually
far less of a problem than had been imagined and usually brings with
it a sense of satisfaction. Action is therefore the saving grace of an
INTP, for a sense of achievement usually outweighs the earlier
apprehension. Social appointments can also be greatly enjoyed, once
they are underway. But joyful anticipation is rarely experienced
beforehand, unless the event is central to the INTP's fields of
interest. The source of the unease is simply the feeling that a
planned schedule inhibits and robs the INTP of freedom. It is also a
subordination to the plans of others which the independent INTP
resists. Faithfully helping others is not a problem, however, but he
must feel in control of his decision to subordinate or not.

<br/><br/>

INTPs tend to be rather mistrusting of people and are rather
sceptical. However, a lot of their trust is based on what the Ne
function tells them about somebody. This can lead to a naivity and
sometimes to prejudices based on intuitive perceptions of appearence
and style. People can be a problem for INTPs: on the one hand they are
fascinated by some types of people, especially more extraverted
individuals, but a fear of irrational behaviour in others usually
leads to caution. Friendship with INTPs develops at a pace which
depends considerably on the temperament of the other person. INTPs
dislike making the first move and tend to mirror the emotional content
of the other person. A jolly person will quickly bring the INTP out of
his shell, as much as that is possible, while a serious person will
find a serious INTP looking back at him. In this sense, INTPs
preference for intuitive perception (rather than action) with respect
to people results in them resembling a chameleon. The INTP can fit
into many different modes of behaviour, even contradictory ones, in
order to get into the mindset of the other person. The goal is to gain
enough intuitive data to analyse and assess the person. In doing this,
the INTP remains somewhat reserved, never wholly identifying himself
with his surroundings. As chameleons, INTPs are therefore approachable
and open, unless the Ne tells the INTP that the other person is a type
he doesn't like, in which case the reserved attitude may become too
obvious. The chameleon behaviour can be particularly strong when
discussing something. The INTP may even argue something that he
doesn't really believe himself. Sometimes it is for the intellectual
stimulation that comes with the challenge of arguing from a variety of
standpoints. Otherwise, it may be to avoid early conflict before the
situation has been fully assessed. Chameleons hide their true
selves. INTPs do not do this cynically, or indeed all the time, but it
is a result of the strong desire to remain detached and observe.

<br/><br/>

However, where friendship develops rapidly, almost instantly, is when
an INTP meets another INTP or similar temperament. Communication
between such people can become extremely intense, leaving outsiders
baffled. When two INTPs get togther, watch out! All forms of social
graces and host-guest protocols become irrelevant. Both want only to
share concepts and interests and absorb the intellectual stimulation
of the other. Interruption of this process by any social necessity is
undesired and annoying. Often the pair will become oblivious to
everything around them and this may seem almost comical to an
outsider. Introductory greetings such as "how are you?" may just be
given and received with nonchalant disinterest. Conversations are more
likely to open with something like: "Hi, I think I've worked out how
changes in the Borg's command protocols can be routed through
sub-space without compromising their universal teleconnectivity!",
knowing that the other person knows exactly what he's on about. Later,
the host may offer the guest a drink after an hour of discussing the
latest developments in computer technology, and the guest may then
notice that he is thirsty. In most cases however, INTPs have been
groomed by other types into accomodating themselves into the social
world, so that even amongst themselves a minimal level of social
niceties will be given. Favourite topics of discussion are science and
science-fiction, music, computers and any abstract concept with which
one is currently fascinated by.

<br/><br/>

One-to-one conversation is preferred in almost every situation. In a
group situation, INTPs are sensitive to whether they believe they will
be listened to or not. If a dominant (strongly extraverted and loud)
person is present, the INTP will withdraw and sulk, believing the
dominant person to be a brute. If an INTP speaks, he must be listened
to, for he believes his spoken opinions to be important. If not, he
withdraws (at least in spirit) and assumes that the people who do not
listen lack intelligence. Hence, INTPs make very poor leaders, for
they depend too much on the attitudes of others. This is one of the
negative sides of the Ne function. INTPs tend to jump to intuitive
conclusions, can be fatalistic and have little perseverence. On the
other hand, they can make very good assistants to leaders, provided
they and the leader are of one mind, for their perceptive analysis can
give the leadership useful insights which they may overlook, being too
busy with leading. Indeed, INTPs are often glad when someone else
takes over the lead, again providing the leader is of the same
mind. An INTPs ideal is to provide all the ideas for a project and
have a charismatic leader, who agrees with him, carry them out. The
only area in which an INTP will carry out his own ideas to completion
is in his personal interest world, where other people are not
involved. For this reason, INTPs are fascinated by computer technology
as well as the Internet which gives him a voice that he would not
otherwise have. Many of the most dedicated Computer Freaks are
INTPs. Ultimately, INTPs tend to trust machines more than they trust
people and may feel particularly at home in the realm of cybernetics.

<br/><br/>

The Ne-Ti axis is a particularly useful configuration for an interest
in Science Fiction. The Ne provides a fascination for abstract ideas
while the Ti loves analysing the scientific concepts presented. Many
an INTP is a Trekkie, particularly because Star Trek pays a great deal
of attention to logical detail. Unlike much of the general population,
however, INTPs take such science fiction series extremely seriously,
showing the great relative importance attached to the world of
ideas. Examples of fictional characters who INTPs have a natural
affinity for are Avon (Blake's Seven), Data (Star Trek: TNG) and Seven
of Nine (Voyager).

<br/><br/>

General role models for INTPs are individualistic, creative and
perhaps enigmatic people. Innovative free-thinkers who follow their
own new paths are usually greatly respected. Famous historical figures
who attract the INTP's greatest respect are scientists, composers,
inventors and, in society, revolutionary leaders and noble visionaries
who bring about major change. Above all, individualism is the key
factor, while vision is the most highly prized asset.

<br/><br/>

The Ne-Ti axis also leads to a curious duality in the thinking of the
INTP. The dominant Ti core tends to assume the role of a controller
and organiser of his life, while the Ne behaves like a free spirit,
almost childlike in its enthusiasm. The INTP tends to experience these
two forces as an almost continuous tug-of-war, with neither ever quite
gaining the upper hand. He is not disturbed by this duality and can
view it with wistful humour. If he has been free-spiriting for any
length of time, he soon feels duty bound to analyse his behaviour and
systematise it. While if he has been in an analytical mode for a
while, he will soon decide that he can do what he wants freely after
all. It is a yo-yo situation. Generally, INTPs have a very strong
requirement to keep their external, social world as simple and as
uncluttered as they can so that they can focus as much energy as
possible on their internal world of system analysis and
theoretizing. Hence, they tend to be amongst the least demanding and
least complicated of all types when interacting with others. They
prefer to let the world flow by: to observe the waves being made by
others, but to make none themselves. When socializing, the Ne mode
dominates, unless a discussion starts up involving the INTP in which
case the Ti largely takes over. In their private world it is of course
the Ti that dominates.

<br/><br/>

Tertiary Function: Introverted Sensing

<br/><br/>

The Sensing function is the mode of perceiving which gathers
information from facts, details and objects. When this function is
strongly introverted, Si, the focus moves away from external details
and is primarly concerned with personal, introspective detail. The
experience of the present is not central in itself, as with Se. Rather
the focus is on how the present evokes remembered earlier
experiences. The key outworking of the Si function is then a concern
with memories of the past. INTPs typically have an acute awareness of
the passage of past times. Sequences of past events can assume a
remarkable solidity in their thinking, while most INTPs have very good
memories. Indeed, the sensing function is usually very well developed
in its strongly Si mode and forms a strong partnership with the Ti
core. Hence, the internal world of the INTP is a world of complex,
detailed structure, well organized and methodically kept in
order. When an INTP focusses on specific details then he has a very
sharp eye for them and will not lose sight of them.

<br/><br/>

On the other hand, one of the more serious weaknesses of an INTP is
that the sensing function makes little inroads out into the external
world. INTPs are usually oblivious to external details unless
something forces them to take notice. When an INTP goes into a new
room, or walks through a city street, he is blind to much of the
detail that people with an Se function would see immediately. The INTP
always tries to get a feel for the big picture, using his Ne, and
habitually ignores all detail. Of course, objects of interest will be
seen as a matter of course and he can choose to concentrate and focus
on them, but it is remarkable how much he still overlooks. And those
objects he does happen to notice will belong to a small set of things
that he is interested in anyway. Many other objects would only be
noticed if another person points them out to him.

<br/><br/>

When an INTP lives alone, his home is usually spartan and
utility-oriented. There will be little or no decorative objects,
electronic equipement will be in abundance and the importance of any
object will depend only on its usefulness. The general style of the
home is largely irrelevant. When an object is put aside, not to be
returned to for a while, it will lie fully ignored until used
again. Objects which lie unmoved for more than about 48 hours usually
become invisible to the INTP, until such time as he has a use for them
again. For other temperaments whose need for tidiness and order in a
house is strong, this lack of concern in this area may seem
despairing. For the INTP, however, no problem exists. Corners of
rooms, table tops and cupboards may become cluttered with objects, but
while they don't move they remain effectively invisible and are
unimportant. Indeed, less mature INTPs have a reluctance to move
objects at all, for the desire to remain detached and not physically
interact with the world can be strong. The one thing that will force
an INTP to tidy his home radically, even when alone, is when the
clutter eventually gets in his way and hinders some activity. Often,
however, the offending objects will merely be moved into another
corner where they can spend some more weeks being invisible. When an
INTP lives with a partner and perhaps has a family, he learns the
necessity of focussing on the details of tidiness. This is not usually
difficult, since tidying a house is an activity which can be clearly
defined and, hence, the INTP can focus on it by treating it as
systematic work.

<br/><br/>

Introverted Sensing often plays an important role in the private world
of the INTP. When he visits a place, whether new or already known, his
Si function gives an overriding concern for the atmosphere or mood of
the place. In his subconscious, he connects the present experiences of
his surroundings with memories of his past, sometimes deep past. A
sense of history, of universality, is almost always invoked. When on
holiday, the INTP wants to experience above all the ambience of each
location. Specific details in the present are relatively unimportant
and will not be well remembered. However, the atmosphere or mood will
be remembered long after, as though it were a solid object. Since
people encountered on a holiday usually count as details, unless more
personal contact develops, the INTP tends to be drawn more to lonely,
isolated places where atmosphere is less disturbed. Nevertheless, the
presence of people does add its own ambience which can also be
appreciated considerably. The net result of this concern for past
experiences and of mood/atmosphere is that INTPs belong centrally to
those types referred to as melancolic. The INTP melancolic is
typically drawn to wild polar expanses, to mountain ranges and all
places on the edges of civilisation. Whatever his particular yearning
might actually be, it has a common root. The homeland of the INTP's
psyche is a small and cosy community, isolated in the middle of a vast
expanse of wilderness.

<br/><br/>

Because the present is inextricably linked to a sense of the past,
INTPs tend to hoard items which help solidify the connection to the
past. They find it very difficult to let go of anything they have
collected (or indeed created) and which may have a nostalgic
meaning. They assume that any object which is of interest now is bound
to remain of interest for the rest of their lives. This emphasizes a
strong sense of universality in the progression of time, just as it
emphasizes the seriousness with which INTPs approach their
interests. Frivolity is not in their vocabulary. INTPs often love
keeping lists and databases in areas of interest, especially when the
lists are associated with things of the past. Collecting periodical
magazines or other media of interest is also a very common INTP
trait. Such a collection is usually taken very seriously. Yet the
collective whole, considered as a temporal rather than spatial object,
always assumes more importance in the mind of the INTP than the
objects forming the collection themselves. Hence, INTPs are
collectors, but they are collecters for whom the objects themselves
are only important in so far as they evoke a connection to past
events, in so far as they yield a nostalgic mood. The curious problem
with any collection of an INTP is that he typically fails to enjoy it
in the here and now. Items are stored away so that they can evoke this
time at some point in the future, but such a point often never
occurs. It may never occur because INTPs are always so mentally active
that they continually delve into new interests, and continue to hoard
items relating to these, so that they rarely allow themselves enough
time to reflect on the ever expanding library of their past. The
interests of an INTP would be enough to occupy him for several
lifetimes if that were possible.

<br/><br/>

Photography is a classic interest of the INTP, which depends strongly
on the Si - Ne combination, as well as on Ti for attention to
technical detail. Landscape photography, for example, is the art of
conveying a sense of mood/atmosphere to the viewer (Si). The correct
employment of lenses, filters etc. brings out the Ti core, while the
enjoyment of seeing the world as an fascinating varied object to be
observed and captured in the best possible way brings out the Ne-Ti
architect. Photos are also a way of capturing the present to evoke a
sense of past in the future (Si). When involved in portrait or people
photography, the INTP will also be primarily concerned with the mood
conveyed by the person in the eye of the lens. Quality photographic
skill, as well as an intrinsic feel for imagery, is usually second
nature to the INTP and can make a good career choice. When viewing
photographic images, say in magazines, the overriding concern is for
how the photo is conveyed; its mood, its colour, contrast and shading
usages, its perspectives and image quality. However, the actual
subject of the image, which other types are likely to concentrate on
first, takes a back seat unless it is unavoidably dramatic. Hence,
INTPs may convey a very critical and impersonal approach in discussing
images, which could lead to offence in some situations.

<br/><br/>

Another area of interest common to INTPs, where Si has a strong
influence, is Music. INTPs are usually fascinated by music and may
have deep and wide-ranging tastes. Indeed, each of their three main
functions (Ti, Ne, Si) plays a role in the enjoyment of music, and
indeed music is a key interest for bringing out the feeling shadow of
the INTP. Si itself brings a fascination for mood and atmosphere in
music as well as for a strong sense of personal nostalgia. INTPs are
therefore often keen on melancolic minor-key music in which an
introspective and/or esoteric mood is conveyed. Equally, INTPs enjoy
hearing music that they heard and enjoyed when younger (provided they
can still appreciate it now) and yearn for the sense of nostalgia that
it yields. INTPs are also drawn to complexly structured music, thanks
to their Ti core. An appreciation of modern classical music, as well
as perhaps contemporary jazz, is therefore common with them. Such
music types are usually too complex to be understood after a single
hearing, which hence provides excellent material for analysis,
exciting the INTP no end. Once the basic developmental structure of
the music has been assessed, Ne provides the impetus to derive a
general meaning of the piece. What does the composer wish to convey,
for example? Why was that particular development chosen? Indeed, the
Ne is usually hard at work during listening sessions, trying to grasp
the meanings behind the often fascinating combinations of sound-world
evocations, structural developments and nostalgic impressions.

<br/><br/>

When the Ti core dominates the choice of music to listen to, the need
for intellectual stimulation derived from complex structures and
sounds will override concerns for cultured harmony. Hence, INTPs are
often drawn to dissonance. Indeed, they may even thoroughly strive for
dissonant sound worlds. When in such moods, consonant harmonies,
especially of the three-chord-melody variety, are dismissed as boring
and uninspired. If an INTP is forced to listen to simple harmonic
music for a while, he usually can't wait to feel the relief provided
by a few minutes of pure dissonance. The ideal music for the Ti core
might be typically a modern symphony, with a complex, but analysable
structure, with a rich and varied sound world, predominantly dissonant
but with sections of melodic motifs to provide solidity. Examples of
modern classical composers who particularly speak to the Ti core might
be Simpson, Arnold, Holmboe, Maxwell-Davies and Shostakovich.

<br/><br/>

However, feeding the Ti core alone with music will rarely satisfy an
INTP for long. Where music really inspires in when the Si function is
brought into the picture.  Generally, INTPs are fascinated by
atmospheres evoked by music. Examples of modern classical composers
whose music speaks more to the Si-melancoly through sound-world
evocation might be Bax, Tavener, Pärt, Szymanowski and
Rautavaara. Some elements of world-music also speak strongly to the
Si-melancoly. INTPs may be interested in the Folk musics of eastern
Europe and India, for example. The role played by the Si function is
shared by SJ types, so that INTPs may find a common musical bond with
some SJs in this area. Indeed, INTPs often feel at ease with SJs,
especially their near-shadow xSFJ types. The SJ's guardian instincts
usually help the INTP to feel at ease, while the tradition-based
predictability of the SJ approach to life helps the INTP to know where
he stands, giving him the space he needs to relax. Although the most
intense communicative friendships may develop with fellow NTs, some
extraverted intuitive types may overstress the INTP by being too
dominant and unpredictable, extracting too much energy from the Ti
core.

<br/><br/>

Ultimately, however, music forms a vital, central role in awaking the
underdeveloped Fe shadow in the life of an INTP. It is undoutedly Fe
that gives the INTP the life-spark to introduce a genuine sense of joy
that music is experienced with. To the INTP, the role of Fe in music
appreciation remains mysterious. Music forms which may be useful for
awakening the shadow are expressive forms of jazz, where extraverted
Feeling is central to the music-making process, as well as some
expressive Folk styles (Irish for example). Examples of modern
classical composers whose music may appeal to the Fe shadow of INTPs
are Messiaen, Copland, Schnittke, Bartok, Vaughan-Williams and, again,
Shostakovich (Noting that Fe can be expressing a range of positive or
negative feelings).The music of Shostakovich is a particular favourite
because, alongside its developmental structure, it also yields an
immense sense of passionate tragedy which awakes the Fe-shadow
together with the Si-melancoly.

Inferior Function: Extraverted Feeling

<br/><br/>

Extraverted Feeling judgement, Fe, is the shadow function of the INTP,
being by far the least developed of his faculties. Indeed, mature use
of Fe typically doesn't begin to take shape until well into middle
age. Feelings and emotions are regarded with suspicion and perhaps
fear by the INTP and he may be keen to avoid considering or showing
them. At the same time, he may experience a certain fascination for
the emotional world, but he is desperate to de-personalize any
thoughts on that area. He is compelled to subject his emotions to
continual analysis, the Ti core literally suppressing the Fe shadow,
attacking Fe with accusations of irrationality. He resists letting his
feelings go, fearing that to do so would be to relinquish control to
an unknown force. He believes emotions to be of a lesser substance
than logic and his natural goal would be to conquer his emotions with
pure rationality.

<br/><br/>

Much of the above demonstrates the immature and underdeveloped
approach with which the INTP meets his emotional side. In reality, the
extraverted nature of the INTP's feeling judgement means that his
emotions, when visible, are pretty direct and easy to assess. Since
the INTP normally wishes to hide his emotions; when they do come out,
they do so in outbursts with an almost childlike innocence. There is a
sense of all-or-nothing and, when visible, there is nothing enigmatic
about the feelings of an INTP: indeed, shadow functions always seem
pretty raw and basic.

<br/><br/>

When making on the spot decisions while extraverting with another
person, the shadow Fe is often temporally exposed on the front
line. Its immature nature may then result in an inadequate decision
being made. The INTP may regret this later when the Ti core has
analysed the events. Hence, INTPs tend to resist being forced to make
quick decisions, for they know that their Fe judgement is their
achilles heel. However, the resistance is sometimes weakened when Ne
jumps in to back up the Fe. The accuracy of the intuitive insight then
becomes crucial if the INTP is to avoid fatal errors. It is
interesting to observe that the external world of the INTP involves a
very free-spirited Ne-Fe partnership, while the internal world is a
very clinical detail-structure-analysis Ti-Si combination. Hence, the
outward behaviour of an INTP can contrast strongly with his
introspective world.

<br/><br/>

For the INTP, emotions are seen as something mysterious and as
uncontrollable as they are unalterable. Hence, the root of the fear of
emotions is the fear that they cannot be controlled. Hence, when an
INTP does finally respond emotionally to something, his emotions are
indeed left uncontrolled, raw and open. However, when witnessing the
emotional response of another person, the INTP intensely resists any
similar emotion of his own. An example of this is when watching a
'weepy' cinema film in which some heart-wrenching scene is being
shown. The INTP despises the attempt by the filmmaker to influence his
emotions and is more likely to sneer than cry. This response has
nothing to do with arrogance, however. Rather it is the INTP
defensively avoiding exposing what he knows to be his weak
point. Where an INTP may experience his own emotional response during
a film is when he has had the chance to consider consequences of a
element of the film. Hence, emotional response to media input usually
occurs with a certain independence of will, which could appear
enigmatic to others.

<br/><br/>

The mystery of emotion is also evidence in the INTP's use of music. He
always chooses to listen to music which suits his current emotional
state, be it aggression, warmth, excitement, relaxation or
whatever. Hence, the emotional state is assumed to be an unchangeable,
mysterious property of himself. It is easier to choose appropriate
music than to attempt to influence this. People with introverted
Feeling, Fi, however, will deliberately choose to listen to music
which helps them change and improve their mood. INTPs could never do
that. They feel an unpleasant sense of disharmony whenever a music
style clashes with their emotional state. Indeed, it is remarkable how
much attention they pay to their emotions when music is involved.

<br/><br/>

Sexuality is another important area which brings out the Fe shadow of
the INTP. Sexuality fascinates INTPs in a similar way to music. Both
have an emotional core which does not entirely yield to
analysis. Sexual feelings often clash with the INTPs desire to control
and understand his universe. They also clash with the desire for
detachment and keeping a distance. But sexuality is the one thing
who's natural power can break through any type dynamics. Hence,
sexuality can play a big role in balancing the INTP's
functionality. However, the INTP's natural approach to sexuality will
still have true-to-type elements. He will be keen to understand and
categorise his sexual responses. He will be keen to see first the
generalities of male- and femaleness before any personal references
are made. Nevertheless, in an intimate relationship, the extraverted
nature of the feeling judgement leads to a beneficial openness and
empathic directness in responding to the partner's needs, providing
the healthy development of the Fe function is encouraged. Indeed, for
many INTPs, an intimate relationship is the only place where the Fe
shadow can really develop fruitfully.

<br/><br/>

The inferior nature of the Fe shadow shows itself, otherwise, in the
lack of ability to show active empathy with people undergoing strong
emotions. If he wishes to encourage the emotional person, the INTP
tends to resort to giving T-based solutions to the problems
involved. Often, the INTP does not really know how to empathize and
may feel discomfort and helplessness, especially when he understands
the rational basis for the emotions. He may become frustrated that the
person remains unhappy in spite of hearing his T-based solutions. Much
worse is when the emotional person appears to be being
irrational. INTPs detest irrational emotion above all things. INTPs
must take a very wide berth around people who appear to be
irrationally, outwardly emotional. INTPs are very sensitive to such a
trait and fear the potential excesses of the emotional attacks which
do not yield to a defence based on logic.

<br/><br/>

In a similar way, INTPs dislike being in an atmosphere of emotional
disharmony. If they need to say something unpleasant to someone close
to them, they would prefer to avoid this task for fear of the
disharmony that may result. This results from the INTP's fear that he
does not have the emotional competence to deal with disharmony. INTPs
never like doing something until they know they can do it. The best
cure for this reticence is experience: to express his feelings, to
live through disharmony and come out the other side with greater
experience of his emotional side.

<br/><br/>

The feeling shadow is the fear centre of the INTP. He rarely fears any
factual thing in the outside world, at least not things that will be
encountered in normal day-to-day living. Logic stipulates that
external objects or people which threaten can always potentially be
dealt with by instigating an active defence strategy. Of course, the
possibility of being left truly helpless leaves the INTP cold, for
once the Ti core is defeated, the inferior Fe can offer little
comfort. Resigned acceptance of the unacceptable is an anathema for
INTPs. His typical response to helplessness is to hate the world which
has produced it. However, the greatest fears of an INTP are usually
ideas generated within his own mind. The problem is that the Ti-Ne
axis is capable of conceiving very unpleasant ideas, which may be far
from reality and even irrational. Ideas and possibilities assume so
much importance in the mind of an INTP that they can override a common
sense factual grasp on reality. Since the emotional response to an
unpleasant idea is based on an underdeveloped function, it may also
fail to bring a return to common sense. The net result is the fear
that ideas alone may lead to self-destruction. This fear is irrational
and is a cry of help from the feeling shadow when being overdominated
by the Ti-Ne axis. This problem can be overcome when more balanced
type dynamics result from increasing maturity.
