<h3>INFJ</h3>

http://typelogic.com/infj.html

<br/>
<br/>

Beneath the quiet exterior, INFJs hold deep convictions about the weightier
matters of life. Those who are activists -- INFJs gravitate toward such a role
-- are there for the cause, not for personal glory or political power.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are champions of the oppressed and downtrodden. They often are found in
the wake of an emergency, rescuing those who are in acute distress. INFJs may
fantasize about getting revenge on those who victimize the defenseless. The
concept of 'poetic justice' is appealing to the INFJ.

<br/>
<br/>

"There's something rotten in Denmark." Accurately suspicious about others'
motives, INFJs are not easily led. These are the people that you can rarely fool
any of the time. Though affable and sympathetic to most, INFJs are selective
about their friends. Such a friendship is a symbiotic bond that transcends mere
words.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs have a knack for fluency in language and facility in communication. In
addition, nonverbal sensitivity enables the INFJ to know and be known by others
intimately.

<br/>
<br/>

Writing, counseling, public service and even politics are areas where INFJs
frequently find their niche.

<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis:

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted intuitives, INFJs enjoy a greater clarity of perception of inner,
unconscious processes than all but their INTJ cousins. Just as SP types commune
with the object and "live in the here and now" of the physical world, INFJs
readily grasp the hidden psychological stimuli behind the more observable
dynamics of behavior and affect. Their amazing ability to deduce the inner
workings of the mind, will and emotions of others gives INFJs their reputation
as prophets and seers. Unlike the confining, routinizing nature of introverted
sensing, introverted intuition frees this type to act insightfully and
spontaneously as unique solutions arise on an event by event basis.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted feeling, the auxiliary deciding function, expresses a range of
emotion and opinions of, for and about people. INFJs, like many other FJ types,
find themselves caught between the desire to express their wealth of feelings
and moral conclusions about the actions and attitudes of others, and the
awareness of the consequences of unbridled candor. Some vent the attending
emotions in private, to trusted allies. Such confidants are chosen with care,
for INFJs are well aware of the treachery that can reside in the hearts of
mortals. This particular combination of introverted intuition and extraverted
feeling provides INFJs with the raw material from which perceptive counselors
are shaped.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

The INFJ's thinking is introverted, turned toward the subject. Perhaps it is
when the INFJ's thinking function is operative that he is most aloof. A comrade
might surmise that such detachment signals a disillusionment, that she has also
been found lacking by the sardonic eye of this one who plumbs the depths of the
human spirit. Experience suggests that such distancing is merely an indication
that the seer is hard at work and focusing energy into this less efficient
tertiary function.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are twice blessed with clarity of vision, both internal and external. Just
as they possess inner vision which is drawn to the forms of the unconscious,
they also have external sensing perception which readily takes hold of worldly
objects. Sensing, however, is the weakest of the INFJ's arsenal and the most
vulnerable. INFJs, like their fellow intuitives, may be so absorbed in intuitive
perceiving that they become oblivious to physical reality. The INFJ under stress
may fall prey to various forms of immediate gratification. Awareness of
extraverted sensing is probably the source of the "SP wannabe" side of
INFJs. Many yearn to live spontaneously; it's not uncommon for INFJ actors to
take on an SP (often ESTP) role.

<br/>

The Protector

<br/>
<br/>

As an INFJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take
things in primarily via intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you
deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit with your
personal value system.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are gentle, caring, complex and highly intuitive individuals. Artistic and
creative, they live in a world of hidden meanings and possibilities. Only one
percent of the population has an INFJ Personality Type, making it the most rare
of all the types.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs place great importance on havings things orderly and systematic in their
outer world. They put a lot of energy into identifying the best system for
getting things done, and constantly define and re-define the priorities in their
lives. On the other hand, INFJs operate within themselves on an intuitive basis
which is entirely spontaneous. They know things intuitively, without being able
to pinpoint why, and without detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. They are
usually right, and they usually know it. Consequently, INFJs put a tremendous
amount of faith into their instincts and intuitions. This is something of a
conflict between the inner and outer worlds, and may result in the INFJ not
being as organized as other Judging types tend to be. Or we may see some signs
of disarray in an otherwise orderly tendency, such as a consistently messy desk.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs have uncanny insight into people and situations. They get "feelings" about
things and intuitively understand them. As an extreme example, some INFJs report
experiences of a psychic nature, such as getting strong feelings about there
being a problem with a loved one, and discovering later that they were in a car
accident. This is the sort of thing that other types may scorn and scoff at, and
the INFJ themself does not really understand their intuition at a level which
can be verbalized. Consequently, most INFJs are protective of their inner
selves, sharing only what they choose to share when they choose to share
it. They are deep, complex individuals, who are quite private and typically
difficult to understand. INFJs hold back part of themselves, and can be
secretive.

<br/>
<br/>

But the INFJ is as genuinely warm as they are complex. INFJs hold a special
place in the heart of people who they are close to, who are able to see their
special gifts and depth of caring. INFJs are concerned for people's feelings,
and try to be gentle to avoid hurting anyone. They are very sensitive to
conflict, and cannot tolerate it very well. Situations which are charged with
conflict may drive the normally peaceful INFJ into a state of agitation or
charged anger. They may tend to internalize conflict into their bodies, and
experience health problems when under a lot of stress.

<br/>
<br/>

Because the INFJ has such strong intuitive capabilities, they trust their own
instincts above all else. This may result in an INFJ stubborness and tendency to
ignore other people's opinions. They believe that they're right. On the other
hand, INFJ is a perfectionist who doubts that they are living up to their full
potential. INFJs are rarely at complete peace with themselves - there's always
something else they should be doing to improve themselves and the world around
them. They believe in constant growth, and don't often take time to revel in
their accomplishments. They have strong value systems, and need to live their
lives in accordance with what they feel is right. In deference to the Feeling
aspect of their personalities, INFJs are in some ways gentle and easy
going. Conversely, they have very high expectations of themselves, and
frequently of their families. They don't believe in compromising their ideals.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJ is a natural nurturer; patient, devoted and protective. They make loving
parents and usually have strong bonds with their offspring. They have high
expectations of their children, and push them to be the best that they can
be. This can sometimes manifest itself in the INFJ being hard-nosed and
stubborn. But generally, children of an INFJ get devoted and sincere parental
guidance, combined with deep caring.

<br/>
<br/>

In the workplace, the INFJ usually shows up in areas where they can be creative
and somewhat independent. They have a natural affinity for art, and many excel
in the sciences, where they make use of their intuition. INFJs can also be found
in service-oriented professions. They are not good at dealing with minutia or
very detailed tasks. The INFJ will either avoid such things, or else go to the
other extreme and become enveloped in the details to the extent that they can no
longer see the big picture. An INFJ who has gone the route of becoming
meticulous about details may be highly critical of other individuals who are
not.

<br/>
<br/>

The INFJ individual is gifted in ways that other types are not. Life is not
necessarily easy for the INFJ, but they are capable of great depth of feeling
and personal achievement.

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/>
<br/>

Dominant: Introverted Intuition
<br/>
Auxilliary: Extraverted Feeling
<br/>
Tertiary: Introverted Thinking
<br/>
Inferior: Extraverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFJ

<br/>
<br/>
Keirsey referred to the INFJs as Counselors, one of the four types belonging to
the temperament he called the Idealists. One of the rarest types, INFJs
account for 1-3% of the population.

<br/>
<br/>
I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: INFJs tend to be quiet and
  reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather
  than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social
  situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).
  
<br/>
<br/>
N - Intuition preferred to sensing: INFJs tend to be more abstract than
  concrete. They focus on the big picture rather than the details, and on future
  possibilities rather than immediate realities.
  
<br/>
<br/>
F - Feeling preferred to thinking: INFJs tend to value personal considerations
  above objective criteria. When making decisions, they often give more weight
  to social implications than to logic.
  
<br/>
<br/>
J - Judgment preferred to perception: INFJs tend to plan their activities and
  make decisions early. They derive a sense of control through
  predictability. 
  
<br/>
<br/>    

Characteristics of INFJs

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are conscientious and value-driven. They seek meaning in relationships,
ideas, and events, with an eye toward better understanding themselves and
others. Using their intuitive skills, they develop a clear and confident vision,
which they then set out to execute, aiming to better the lives of others. Like
their INTJ counterparts, INFJs regard problems as opportunities to design and
implement creative solutions.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are quiet, private individuals who prefer to exercise their influence
behind the scenes. Although very independent, INFJs are intensely interested in
the well-being of others. INFJs prefer one-on-one relationships to large
groups. Sensitive and complex, they are adept at understanding complicated
issues and driven to resolve differences in a cooperative and creative
manner.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs have a rich, vivid inner life, which they may be reluctant to share with
those around them. Nevertheless, they are congenial in their interactions, and
perceptive of the emotions of others. Generally well-liked by their peers, they
may often be considered close friends and confidants by most other
types. However, they are guarded in expressing their own feelings, especially to
new people, and so tend to establish close relationships slowly. INFJs tend to
be easily hurt, though they may not reveal this except to their closest
companions. INFJs may "silently withdraw as a way of setting limits", rather
than expressing their wounded feelings-a behavior that may leave others confused
and upset.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs tend to be sensitive, quiet leaders with a great depth of
personality. They are intricately and deeply woven, mysterious, and highly
complex, sometimes puzzling even to themselves. They have an orderly view toward
the world, but are internally arranged in a complex way that only they can
understand. Abstract in communicating, they live in a world of hidden meanings
and possibilities. With a natural affinity for art, INFJs tend to be creative
and easily inspired. Yet they may also do well in the sciences, aided by
their intuition.

<br/>
<br/>

Correlation with Enneatype

<br/>
<br/>

According to Baron and Wagele, the most common Enneatypes for the INFJ are The
Individualist (Fours), The Reformer (Ones), and The Peacemaker (Nines).

<br/>
<br/>

http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/myers-briggs/infj.htm

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs direct their energy towards the inner world of thoughts and
emotions. They use their imagination to come up with new ideas,
possibilities and insights, especially in relation to people and
important beliefs. They are often good at developing insight into
people, though it can often remain unexpressed. 
What makes an INFJ tick?

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the perceptive one of iNtuition. Characteristics associated with this function include:

<br/>
<br/>

* Likes looking at information from a global viewpoint, spotting patterns and
<br/>
relationships, that lead to an understanding of the key issues 
<br/>
* Focuses more on possibilities for the future than the here-and-now 
<br/>
* Enjoys change, challenge, and variety 

<br/>
<br/>

The perceptive iNtuition function is introverted. That is, iNtuition is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The INFJ will therefore:

<br/>
<br/>

* Seek to develop a understanding of how the world is, or can be
<br/>
* Seek to understand the patterns underlying his/her observations
<br/>
* Be strategic in nature, wanting to establish a clear vision towards which the INFJ is working
<br/>
* Not involve others in the development of that vision 

<br/>
<br/>

The iNtuition function is primarily supported by extraverted Feeling judgement, That is, Feeling judgement is used primarily to manage the outer world of actions and spoken words. This will modify the way that the iNtuition is directed, by:

<br/>
<br/>

* focusing the (inner world) iNtuition on ideas and possibilities that relate to people
<br/>
* expressing appreciation for the contributions of others, particularly where they have done or said something that supports the INFJ's ideals
<br/>
* making decisions on the basis of values that support the INFJ's understanding of the world, and conform to his/her vision. 

<br/>
<br/>

The classic temperament of an INFJ is Apollonian, or Choleric, for whom a basic driving force is the search for meaning or purpose.
Contributions to the team of an INFJ

<br/>
<br/>

In a team environment, the INFJ can contribute by:

<br/>
<br/>

* observing and understanding the team dynamics, and encouraging the team to recognise them and take appropriate action
<br/>
* listening carefully to various viewpoints, and being able to identify potential areas of agreement to be used as a basis to move forward
<br/>
* being trustworthy, meeting commitments to a consistent standard
<br/>
* contributing creative ideas, particularly those involving people
<br/>
* bringing the team to make decisions about important issues
<br/>
* promoting harmony and co-operation 

<br/>
<br/>

The potential ways in which an INFJ can irritate others include:

<br/>
<br/>
* not including others in the INFJ's process of developing ideas and vision
<br/>
* not giving criticism or expressing disagreement when it is appropriate
<br/>
* ignoring current reality in pursuit of insight and meaning - perhaps overlooking some tasks that need to be done
<br/>
* making errors of fact
<br/>
* not promoting their ideas in the group
<br/>
* wanting to pursue ideas without fully thinking through the consequences in, say, cost terms 

<br/>
<br/>

Personal Growth
<br/>
<br/>

As with all types, the INFJ can achieve personal growth by developing all
functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as: 

<br/>
<br/>

* being prepared to declare the INFJ's own personal vision or goals
<br/>
* investigating and recognising the facts before interpreting what they mean
<br/>
* changing his/her vision to fit more closely with what is possible
<br/>
* allowing others to participate in the process of development of the INFJ's
vision or ideas, in order to gain their commitment or get a realistic, objective
assessment 
<br/>
* learning to promote the INFJ's ideas to others, recognising that others may
well find them valuable 
<br/>
* listing options and undertaking a formal process of evaluation against
criteria, including a cost benefit analysis  

<br/>
<br/>

Recognising Stress

<br/>
<br/>

As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the INFJ will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the INFJ might:

<br/>
<br/>

* find a place of solitude in which to think and work
<br/>
* tell everyone else how well they are coping
<br/>
* try to solve the long term problem, and neglect the short term
<br/>
* make errors of fact, or ignore routine matters that might nevertheless be
essential  

<br/>
<br/>

Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the INFJ's shadow may appear - a
negative form of ESTP. Example characteristics are: 

<br/>
<br/>

* acting very impulsively, making decisions without thinking them through
<br/>
* doing things to excess - e.g.: eating, drinking or exercising
<br/>
* being critical of others, and finding fault with almost everything
<br/>
* being preoccupied about unimportant details and doing things that have no meaning
<br/>
* acting in a very materialistic and selfish way
<br/>
* cutting corners, breaking the rules, and even contradicting the INFJ's own
values  

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are warm and affirming people who are usually also deep and
complex. They're likely to seek out and promote relationships that are
intense and meaningful. They tend to be perfectionists, and are always
striving for the Ultimate Relationship. For the most part, this is a
positive feature, but sometimes works against the INFJ if they fall
into the habit of moving from relationship to relationship, always in
search of a more perfect partner. In general, the INFJ is a deeply
warm and caring person who is highly invested in the health of their
close relationships, and puts forth a lot of effort to make them
positive. They are valued by those close to them for these special
qualities. They seek long-term, lifelong relationships, although they
don't always find them.

<br/>

"To love means to open ourselves to the negative as well as the
positive - to grief, sorrow, and disappointment as well as to joy,
fulfillment, and an intensity of consciousness we did not know was
possible before." -- Rollo May 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are warm, considerate partners who feel great depth of love for
their partners. They enjoy showing this love, and want to receive
affirmation back from their mates. 
<br/>
<br/>

They are perfectionists, constantly striving to achieve the Perfect
Relationship. This can sometimes be frustrating to their mates, who
may feel put upon by the INFJs demanding perfectionism. However, it
may also be greatly appreciated, because it indicates a sincere
commitment to the relationship, and a depth of caring which is not
usually present in other types. 
<br/>
<br/>

Sexually, INFJs view intimacy as a nearly spiritual experience. They
embrace the opportunity to bond heart and soul with their mates. As
service-oriented individuals, it's very important to them that their
mates are happy. Intimacy is an opportunity for the INFJ to selflessly
give their love, and experience it in a tangible way. 
<br/>
<br/>

Although two well-developed individuals of any type can enjoy a
healthy relationship, INFJ's natural partner is the ENTP, or the
ENFP. INFJ's dominant function of Introverted Intuition is best
matched with a personality type that is dominated by Extraverted
Intuition.
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs as Friends
<br/>
<br/>

Although the INFJ is likely to put friends behind their God and their
families in terms of importance, they do value their friendships. As
idealists who have strong value systems, INFJs seek authenticity and
depth in their close relationships, and especially value people who
can see and appreciate the INFJ for who they are and what they stand
for. 
<br/>
<br/>

The INFJ is likely to spend a lot of time socialing with family
members. If they are religious, they probably are social with members
of their religious community. After that, the INFJ may have friends
represented from any of the personality types. They are usually
extremely intuitive individuals, who will have no patience for anyone
they feel is dishonest or corrupt. They'll have no interest in being
around these kinds of people. 
<br/>
<br/>

All kinds of people are drawn towards the INFJ. They are usually quite
popular, although they may be unaware of it themselves, because they
don't place a lot of importance on it. 
<br/>
<br/>

The INFJ is valued by their close friends for their warmth and
consideration, their new and interesting ways of looking at things,
and for their ability to inspire and motivate others to be the best
that they can be. genuine article that they are.

<br/>
<br/>

If Meyers Briggs personality test identifies you as an INFJ
personality type, you are introvert, intuitive, value-oriented and
well organized personality. You take your energy from your solitude,
inner thought and emotions. You perceive information with the help of
your intuition. You can sacrifice heartless logic for your value
system. 
<br/>
<br/>

Meyers Briggs personality test declares you suitable for those careers
where intuitive solutions and harmonious relations are required. You
prefer to stay away from crowd. You are individualistic and follow
others only if they are moving towards the same direction as your
value system guides you. 
<br/>
<br/>

Meyers Briggs personality tests consider you important also for those
careers where new possibilities and potentials are to be handled. Some
of the considered careers include: 
<br/>
<br/>

Scientists,Psychologists,Psychiatrists,WritersPlaywright,Poet,Novelists,Art
Editors,News
Editors,Photographers,Musicians,Actors,Artists,Entertainers,Social
Workers,Religious Leader,Medicine Doctors,Education
Consultants,Librarians,Human Resource Developer,Lawyers,Job

<br/>
<br/>

INFJ's are often an inspiration to others. They find themselves in the
middle of family because they are often insightful and keen at
interrupting tension. If there is too much family tension, INFJ's will
shun the tension centers conversely if there is a center of joy and
warmth the INFJ may never leave. 
<br/>
<br/>

The INFJ can be quiet and unassuming if not stimulated in a
group. They may appear disinterested but below the surface are a
thousand ideas waiting to come out. Once those ideas are tapped they
often become the life of the party. They can also shut down just as
fast as they start up which often confuses people. 
<br/>
<br/>

In relationships the INFJ can create problems out of their desire to
eliminate them. They have such an over-riding want for harmony that
they often try too hard to avoid discord. INFJ's will ignore inner
burdens in an effort to avoid the external, creating a pressure filled
potential for explosion. Once the INFJ learns to articulate its want
for harmony the achievement is that much more attainable. 
<br/>
<br/>

Career
<br/>
<br/>

The INFJ enjoys working and learning and can often be found in the
educational fields that allow for further development. They enjoy
working and often take pride in the work and people they work
with. They often forget to articulate this pride, which can frustrate
those working with them. Other popular INFJ career directions include:
Career Counselor, Psychologist, Special Education Teacher and
Architects. 

<br/>
<br/>
Education

<br/>
<br/>
Any chance the INFJ has to learn and broaden their horizons, they
will. That is good news in the scholastic environment. The INFJ has
the ability to dream even though they don't always reveal it. It often
manifests itself in their ability to succeed in creative
situations. Their love of learning will take them to rewarding heights
in the classroom.  

<br/>
<br/>
http://community.nbtsc.org/wiki/INFJ;1.8
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are gentle, compassionate, and accepting, yet given to streaks
of extreme stubbornness. When INFJs are committed to an ideal or
cause, the stubbornness surfaces. These otherwise compliant, reserved
individuals become extremely rigid and demanding of themselves and
others, when pursuing a goal in the external world... INFJs are
dreamers whose genius, caring, and concern can be an inspiration to
many other people. In almost any interpersonal activity, from a board
meeting to an intimate family gathering, the INFJ's quiet strength is
felt by others.
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs often have, without formal training, skills in group
dynamics. Almost psychically, they are aware of various levels of
interaction between and among people. However, such awareness remainds
largely their own, and efforts to make these observations known to
others can be frustrating to INFJs.

<br/>
<br/>
As children, INFJs are frequently very complacent. Except for the
stubbornness exhibited around values they prize, their love of
harmony, coupled with a general curiosity and hunger for knowledge,
makes them compliant children and excellent students. Learning
enriches the mind and the INFJ learns very early on that his or her
mind is the gateway to the world.
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs focus on possibilities, think in terms of values and come easily
to decisions. The small number of this type (1 percent) is
regrettable, since INFJs have unusually strong drive to contribute to
the welfare of others and genuinely enjoy helping their fellow
men. This type has great depth of personality; they are themselves
complicated, and can understand and deal with complex issues and
people.

<br/>
<br/>
It is an INFJ who is likely to have visions of human events past,
present, or future. If a person demonstrates an ability to understand
psychic phenomena better than most others, this person is apt to be an
INFJ. Characteristically, INFJs have strong empathic abilities and can
be aware of another's emotions or intents even before that person is
conscious of these. This can take the form of feeling the distress of
illnesses of others to an extent which is difficult for other
types. INFJs can intuit good and evil in others, although they seldom
can tell how they came to know. Subsequent events tend to bear them
out, however.

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs are usually good students, achievers who exhibit an
unostentacious creativity. They take their work seriously and enjoy
academic activity. They can exhibit qualities of over-perfectionism
and put more into a task than perhaps is justified by the nature of
the task. They generally will not be visible leaders, but will quietly
exert influence behind the scenes.

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs are hard to get to know. They have an unusually rich inner life,
but they are reserved and tend not to share their reactions except
with those they trust. Because of their vulnerability through a strong
facility to introject, INFJs can be hurt rather easily by others,
which, perhaps, is at least one reason they tend to be private
people. People who have known an INFJ for years may find sides
emerging which come as a surprise. Not that INFJs are inconsistent;
they are very consistent and value integrity. But they have
convoluted, complex personalities which sometimes puzzle even them.

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs like to please others and tend to contribute their own best
efforts in all situations. They prefer and enjoy agreeing with others,
and find conflict disagreeable and destructive. What is known as ESP
is likely found in an INFJ more than in any other types, although
other types are capable of such phenomena. INFJs have vivid
imaginations exercised both as memory and intuition, and this can
amount to genius, resulting at times in an INFJ's being seen as
mystical. This unfettered imagination often will enable this person to
compose complex and often aesthetic works of art such as music,
mathematical systems, poems, plays, and novels. In a sense, the INFJ
is the most poetic of all the types. Just as the ENTJ cannot not lead,
so must an INFJ intuit; this capability extends to people, things, and
often events, taking the form of visions, episodes of foreknowledge,
premonitions, auditory and visual images of things to come. INFJs can
have uncanny communications with certain individuals at a distance.

<br/>
<br/>
Note for INFJs on getting along with others:

<br/>
<br/>
You are the most empathic. -Show that you know.- You're very aware of
people's feelings; you seldom need an explanation of interpersonal
dynamics, but you don't always do something about them. You know very
well that your mate needs a stroke or an "I love you," but it's not
your day to give strokes so you clam up. Push yourself to give when
your mate needs it, not only when you feel "inspired."

<br/>

INFJs are future oriented, and direct their insight and inspiration
toward the understanding of themselves and thereby human nature. Their
work mirrors their integrity, and it needs to reflect their inner
ideals. Solitude and an opportunity to concentrate thoroughly on what
counts most is important to them. INFJs prefer to quietly exert their
influence. They have deeply felt compassion, and they desire harmony
with others. INFJs understand the complexities existing within people
and among them. They are at their best concentrating on their ideas,
ideals, and inspirations.

<br/>
<br/>
INFJ children have two sides. They can be very much involved in the
world of people, as well as quiet, imaginative, and in their own
world. They are usually gentle and abhor violence. As teenager, INFJs
look for a small group of people who understand and appreciate
them. Without this support, they can feel isolated from others. INFJs
who do not find a supportive social group may find the teen years to
be somewhat difficult for them because of peer pressure to be popular
and activity oriented. They are not likely to enjoy large parties, but
prefer intimate groups of close and long-standing friends.
<br/>
<br/>

Many INFJs who have the opportunity to gravitate toward higher
education where they often find their niche. With their intellectual
bent, they are led to endeavors that allow them to deal with theory
and complexity. Professors often spot their intellectual inclination
and encourage it. 

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs often settle early into a career choice and diligently apply
themselves to the career's requirements. This same diligent pattern
applies when selecting other important things in their lives, such as
where to live, who to marry, and what activities are worthy of their
dedication. 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs have an internal picture of how they would like their work to
contribute to the general good. If they are in an appropriate career
area, INFJs may reap the rewards of their insight and hard
work. Because of their future-focus, their people orientation, and
their push toward task completion, they may rise to positions of
responsibility.
<br/>
<br/>

Learning
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs have a strong love of learning, and they tend to do well
academically. Through persistence, diligence, and conscientiousness,
they complete their assignments on time. They are likely to enjoy
research and will go great lengths to find answers. 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs enjoy investigating the possibilities and meanings beyond the
actual facts and realities. Reading holds a particular fascination for
them because it allows them to have quiet reflection time and engages
their imagination. They also like the written word (and rely on it
more than the spoken word) since it is usually better structured and
more coherent with a ready-made framework. 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs write and communicate well because they want to formulate their
ideas clearly. They place high regard on their reader and
audience. They seek to communicate their ideals to others. When their
ideals need to be championed, they speak up in an enthusiastic and
impassioned way. 
<br/>
<br/>

As students, INFJs prefer learning from teachers whom they both like
and admire, and who give them personal attention. INFJs are often
'model' students. They are quiet and orderly, reflective and
thoughtful, and sincerely want to please their teachers and learn the
right thing. They learn best from others but want time to assimilate
material by themselves. 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs will go beyond what has been presented and often mull material
over in their minds. Occasionally they will discuss ruminations with
others in order to learn even more. They particularly like the more
conceptual and theoretical classes, therefore, higher education is
comfortable to them. 

<br/>
<br/>
Working
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs tend to be devoted to what they believe in and seek work where
their needs, values, and ideals can be deeply engaged. They move on
the wave of their inspirations and are determined to see that their
values are worked out in their lives. They will work toward their
goals individually and, when needed, will put together a team of other
highly dedicated people like themselves. They are personal be with
others, working with integrity and consistency, and they follow
through on their commitments. INFJs, while concentrating on what is
important to them, may ignore the political ramifications of their
actions. They can be surprised by the necessity of being political and
usually resent that aspect of organizational life. Being able to talk
honestly and comfortably to people at work is much more important to
them than 'playing games.'
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs orient themselves toward their goals using a personal,
values-based framework. They do not 'advertise' their values and
priorities because they believe in harmony and positive
relationships. However, one would do well not to underestimate the
amount of perseverance, energy, and time INFJs give to their
priorities. What they do, they do with an almost religious intensity. 
<br/>
<br/>

The INFJ external environment may be only partially organised. Their
internal environment, by contrast, is anything but haphazard. Their
ideas need to fit into a coherent whole that has the pieces in
place. Organization of the internal world takes precedence over
organization of external world. 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs prefer occupations that focus on the big picture, involve
conceptual awareness, and lead to a better understanding of the
spiritual, emotional, or future needs of people. They want their work
to have impact and meaning and for it to bring them admiration and
respect. 

<br/>
<br/>
While INFJs can and do enter all occupations, some are more appealing
to them than others. These include clergy, education consultant,
English teacher, fine arts teacher, librarian, psychiatrist,
psychologist, scientist, social worker, and other occupations that
allow INFJs an opportunity to make their own creative contribution.  
<br/>
<br/>

Leading
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs lead through their quiet yet persistent and determined effort
toward long-range goals for themselves, others and their
organizations. In working toward their vision, they win cooperation
rather than demand it. INFJs work to make their insights real and are
able to inspire others with their ideals. They use a low-key, soft,
yet intense and determined course of action. When they do not directly
lead others, they may still act as facilitators between people. In
meetings, they focus on both people and new ideas. 

<br/>
<br/>
Leisure

<br/>
<br/>
Leisure-time pursuits for INFJs are often solitary or involve the
company of others who are particularly important to them. Sitting
around with dear friends discussing feelings can be very special to
INFJs. INFJs are likely to have friends of long standing rather than
make many new acquaintances. They may meet with their friends fairly
consistently to share what is happening in their lives. It is
sometimes difficult for others to break into this circle. These deep
friendships are important, even though INFJs may not share much
directly about themselves. 
<br/>
<br/>

Loving

<br/>
<br/>
For INFJs, 'still waters run deep.' They tend to become attracted to
someone special and prefer this one deep relationship over many
superficial ones. The depth of involvement and feeling that the INFJ
has toward loved ones is only partially communicated outward. At
times, when alone, INFJs become truly in touch with the depth of the
love they have for their partner. They may not openly demonstrate or
even verbalize their intense feelings. INFJs often have an ideal
standard of what love is. They hold to their ideal and are
disappointed when, inevitably, their relationship and/or mate reveals
flaws. INFJs enjoy sharing activities like a regular 'date,'
revisiting the place where they first met their mates, or doing other
symbolic things that help to continue and confirm the existence of the
bond that they feel for their partner. 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs want to give love and to be loved. They enter into relationships
just to be cared for, even when the person is not right for them and
they suspect it. However, when they meet that special person, they are
quick to get into the relationship and make it a serious one. They
will end their other relationships in order to pursue their loved
one. They become very focused, intense, and direct in that pursuit. 

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs, when scorned, take it personally and retreat inward. They may
obsess about the relationship and their role in its failure. One INFJ
explained, 'people can do the most outrageous things, yet I blame
myself for triggering their behaviour or not recognizing it. I see
myself as responsible for relationships. Other people can dismiss them
--- I'm not able to.' INFJs may blame themselves and experience a
period of mourning. If they do not marshall their resources,
externalized their feelings, and take risks to move on, they may
experience a long periods of self-examination. 

<br/>
<br/>
At work as well as socially, INFJs are highly sensitive in their
handling of others and tend to work well in an organizational
structure. They have a capacity for working at jobs which require
solitude and concentration, but also do well when in contact with
people, providing the human interaction is not superficial. INFJs
enjoy problem-solving and can understand and use human systems
creatively and humanistically. As employees or employers, INFJs are
concerned with people's feelings and are able to provide in themselves
a barometer of the feelings of individuals and groups within the
organizations. INFJs listen well and are willing and able to consult
and cooperate with others. Once a decision is made, they work to
implement it.  
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are generally good at public relations and themselves have good
interpersonal relations. They value staff harmony and want an
organization to run smoothly and pleasantly, themselves making every
effort to contribute to that end. They are crushed by too much
criticism and can have their feelings hurt rather easily. They respond
to praise and use approval as a means of motivating others, just as
they, the INFJs, are motivated by approval. If they are subject to a
hostile, unfriendly working condition or to constant criticism, they
tend to lose confidence, become unhappy and immobilized, and finally
become physically ill. 

<br/>
<br/>
Midlife

<br/>
<br/>
At midlife an INFJ can best continue developing the thinking function
in the form of logic and the pursuit of theory. The pleasure of taking
a theoretical model and applying it to a situation may be a source of
interest which an INFJ may have been neglecting. While continuing to
pursue the person-to-person in feeling-type relationships, at midlife
INFJs may want to get more involved in working with NT's, who offer a
dimension not dominant in NF's and vice versa. Carefully providing for
rest and taking care of physical health is vital to the INFJ at all
times, and mandatory from midlife on.

<br/>
<br/>
INFJ - Quiet, Seek Connection between Ideas, Decisive, Organized
<br/>
<br/>

Introvert - Intuiting - Feeling -Judging
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs look for meaning and connection in ideas, relationships, and
things. They want to understand what motivates people. They focus on
creating a meaningful vision for the greater good. They then want to
implement it in organized and decisive ways. That is they are doers as
well as dreamers. 
<br/>
<br/>

Possibilities, ideals and compassion for people, especially those less fortunate are motivating. They are original, creative, insightful and innovative.

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs are loyal committed, conscientious and idealistic. They value
harmony, agreement and cooperation. They have a strong desire to
contribute to the welfare of others. They are good with language and
communication both written and oral. They tend to be perfectionists
and can be overly sensitive to criticism. 

<br/>
<br/>
Most Developed Skill

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs strongest drive is for theories and possibilities. They see
implications everywhere and are introspective, scholarly and
focused. They are able to express a range of emotion and make great
counselors. 

<br/>
<br/>
Strengths

<br/>
<br/>
Their strengths lie in their clarity of insight, particularly about
people. They are great motivators and conflict resolvers. They are
excellent communicators and creative problem solvers. They can be
charismatic, receptive, adaptable and flexible. They are often fluent
with written and oral language. 

<br/>
<br/>
Skills

<br/>
<br/>
Introvert Intuiting Feeling Judging's dominant skill is in
intuiting. This skill is for seeing the big picture, recognizing
patterns and creating a vision. This pattern is useful for originality
and innovation as well as developing and implementing ideas. 

<br/>
<br/>
Weaknesses

<br/>
<br/>
Self absorption can make them impractical and overlook important details. They can be sensitive to criticism and have high standards for themselves (can be perfectionists). This can lead to putting off the doing of plans, while they keep refining them.

<br/>
<br/>
They can be moody and absent minded. They often have an inability to
criticize and discipline others and be assertive. They may find it
difficult to detach. They have problems working in competitive
environments. 

<br/>
<br/>
Stress Response

<br/>
<br/>
Under stress, they can become withdrawn. They can also become tough
minded, reserved, impulsive, a drama queen and fussy 
<br/>
<br/>

Typical Expression

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs typically express scholarly, complex, innovative ideas. They are
warm and inclusive. 

<br/>
<br/>
Values

<br/>
<br/>
The pattern values introspective reflection and ideas. They crave
private space, autonomy and the opportunity to be productive. 

<br/>
<br/>
Need

<br/>
<br/>
They have high need for harmony, meaningfulness and humanistic
values. They dislike competitive, tense, unpleasant environments 

<br/>
<br/>
Learning

<br/>
<br/>
The Intuiting combination learns best when given the big picture,
implications and possibilities. They are comfortable with abstractions
and theories, particularly in relation to people.

<br/>
<br/>
Least Developed Skill

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs least developed skill is in Sensing - getting sensory
information from the environment. So they tend to jump to conclusions
from limited evidence/facts. 

<br/>
<br/>
A lack of step-by-step logic can show itself as incorrect deductions
that arrive out of the blue without foundation. Learning inductive
reasoning can be useful. This type can also be oblivious to the
external environment. 

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The quest for more knowledge, the meaning of life, the philosophical
questions-my mind is always occupied, and what's exciting is when I
get to follow through with an insight and do something. I am an
abstract future thinker, looking at things from different
perspectives. I'm about the relationships and possibilities and enjoy
anything with deeper meaning that leaves me wondering, with more
questions to ask and things to untangle. Connecting for me means being
able to intuitively ask questions of people to get them to go deeper
into the things they are talking about. 

<br/>
<br/>
Inspiring others, helping them find their purpose or meaning, being a
different kind of leader from what's traditional-that's really
gratifying. I just do that naturally. The challenge is opening up
people's minds to have their own original thoughts. I'm a listener and
guide. 

<br/>
<br/>
I think I am a mystery to people. They never really understand me and
part of me enjoys that. More often though, I long to be understood. 

<br/>
<br/>
I tend to approach my day with a structured way of getting things
accomplished. People see me as organized, thorough, and easy to get
along with, pulling my own weight and eager to help out when called
upon. But I'm not as outgoing or as critical as I may sometimes
appear. I need a balance between people contact and working on
creative projects and will break away from interactions when I get
tired out. If I don't have some long-term goals, then what's the
point? 

<br/>
<br/>
I tend to intuitively read people very quickly, but I have to be
cautious not to make assumptions. I'm an observer. I get a feeling
when people are interesting, and I watch from a distance, make some
assessments about the situation, and then approach them and engage in
conversation. I put a little bit out and a little more and see how
that goes. Do I trust and like them, are they who they say? I have a
few deep friendships. A friendship comes best when it is worked to
develop that investment. I quickly pick up on sincerity and withdraw
if the person is superficial or obviously doesn't care. When I see
people who abuse their power or won't stand behind what they say, that
ticks me off. It's about integrity. I feel other people's feelings,
and taking on that burden can make me too intense and serious, where I
can't be spontaneous and fun loving...

<br/>
<br/>
Everything revolves around growth. Caring is about the ability to help
others grow. What I bring is caring about people, not things. If we
spent more time trying to understand each other's point of view, to
communicate more effectively, we would grow. In an honest, open,
sincere relationship, I can accomplish anything. My challenge is to
create those kinds of relationships. I respect most the person who is
willing to come forth and be an individual-to make the world a better
place, or make a difference in a person's life, where we reach each
other's hearts.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
INFJ Personality types deal with situations how they feel about them or fit into their value based belief system. The mindset is towards the future and inspiration of what could be. INFJs generally hold deep convictions and believe in the ideals and maintenance of the extended group. (Transcending the immediate family group).

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs like INTJs spend considerable amounts of time in reflection,
observation and analysis. It is through this that they enhance their
intuitive abilities. Effectively the ability to predict outcomes,
through subconscious autosuggestion, set against a huge framework of
connective and rational logic. 

<br/>
<br/>
Because the INFJ has such strong intuitive abilities they trust these
instincts as primarily correct. With age and experience these
intuitive abilities heighten. However, this can also lead to being
headstrong and resistant to others conflicting observations. 

<br/>
<br/>
INFJs who have very expressed feeling "may" believe they have psychic
abilities. 

<br/>
<br/>
The majority of INFJs feelings are externally focused towards the
welfare of the collective group rather than of the self. The sheer
ability to place others at the forefront of their lives makes them the
noble Humanitarian, as what else could be a more worthwhile use of
someone's life?

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs possess the prized traits of both intuition (N) and the
implementing Judging (J) function, enabling imagined possibilities to
transgress into actualised reality. As with INTJs there is a desire to
build systems, although these are based on people rather than process
(creating the infrastructure) for change/improvement. 

<br/>
<br/>
Because INFJs are both genuinely kind and complex their close circle
of selected friends holds them in high regard. INFJs are also
concerned with others feelings and tend to avoid situations where this
may hurt people (People are the group, and the group is the system
that the INFJ seeks to build and maintain). INFJs tend also to be
demanding on themselves and strive to ensure congruence with their
values and ideals system whilst looking to improve themselves and the
external world around them. 

<br/>
<br/>
Extended durations of conflict or stress (Both external and internally
generated) can be internalised and manifest itself in health and
psychological conditions. (Hint: Imagine you're flotsam riding the
waves as they pass ;). 

<br/>
<br/>

Such conflict can occur with the innate desire to help the many (F)
requiring a more extroverted personality which clashes with their (I)
introversion, similarly their values systems can be violated by the
very people they wish to help, creating a vicious paradox of
conflicting emotions i.e. (T) Thinking versus the (F).

<br/>
<br/>

Introverts tend to be reflective, reserved and private. A popular misconception is that Introverts are shy - this is not necessarily so. They draw their energy from their own thoughts and the time they spend alone. Introverts do not need people around them all the time.

<br/>
<br/>

iNtuitives pay more attention to information that is imaginative and
original. iNtuitives focus on the future. 

<br/>
<br/>

Feelers let their feelings and emotions play a leading role because of
their concern for other people. 

<br/>
<br/>

Judgers prefer a lifestyle that is decisive, planned and orderly. They
like a life that is organized and controlled. 

<br/>

<br/>

An INFJ at-a-glance

<br/>
<br/>

The difficult I do immediately, the impossible takes me a little
longer! This could be your philosophy of life. People who know INFJ
types well describe them as imaginative, motivated, persistent,
purposeful and creative. 

<br/>
<br/>

Living a life without pretense or facade, being accepted for who you
are, is what matters to you. You prefer to quietly exert your
influence. You bring a quiet enthusiasm to all that you are involved
in. Creating harmony and working towards the common good for all is
one of your key motivators. 

<br/>
<br/>

You have a strong need and desire to understand the complexity of
human relationships. 

<br/>
<br/>

Your sense of empathy allows you to understand and appreciate other's
feelings. You believe in, and act on, your intuition and
instincts. You make decisions easily and your friends and associates
are likely to perceive you as a self-confident and individualistic
thinker. 

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

warning.

<br/>
Can be fiercely loyal to individuals and an organization.


<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are innovative types who feel compelled to use their ideas to
make the world a better place to live. Their desire to create
something new could be as grand as designing the vision for an
organisation, or as simple as speaking to someone in a way which leads
the other to an important insight about themselves. Whatever their
idea or vision, INFJs rarely come across as demanding and usually have
a quiet, yet inspiring way about them.  
 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs' favourite process is intution and this they pursue most readily
while they are on their own. It is in moments of private reflection
that INFJs generate ideas and possibilities. It is also in this
private space that they are most likely to ponder the mysteries and
meaning of life. INFJs are particularly drawn to view life from their
own unique perspective and they are attracted to the idea of "thinking
outside the box". Their combination of preferences means they often
see the world in terms of symbols and metaphors. Many INFJs use their
facility with symbolism in writing, art or teaching. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs often say they have a "quest for knowledge" but they are rarely
interested in learning for its own sake. They can and do make
scientists and academics, but INFJs are less interested in using their
intuition in abstract ways as they prefer to use it in conjunction
with their feeling.  
 
<br/>
<br/>

This means that INFJs usually want their ideas and insights to be of
real tangible benefit to others. They have a great need to feel they
are pursuing a meaningful long-term goal of some kind.  In fact, they
can be so purposeful in the pursuit of their goals that they can often
come across as very practical and task-oriented when in fact they are,
at heart, imaginary, visionary types.  

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs spend much of their time trying to fathom out what makes other
people tick and generally trying to understand them better. They are
particularly drawn to seeing the possibilities for people. "Growth" -
their own and others - is a hugely important word for INFJs. The often
say they enjoy nothing more than connecting and relating to people in
ways which leads that person to obtain insights about themselves and
ideas for their development.  They often describe themselves as
"listeners" and "guides".

<br/>
<br/>

These attitudes and skills are clearly important in some of the jobs
INFJs find attractive - the ministry, teaching, social work and
medicine. They are often attracted into management positions. Even
when they are not in teaching roles as such, they often assume the
role of teacher or mentor, helping to "guide" or inspire their
colleagues to greater things. As leaders they tend to "win" people to
their ideas and views rather than using status or intellectual muscle
to gain support. 
 
<br/>
<br/>

Like other NFs, INFJs have a great need to feel authentic and to be
true to themselves. They are very drawn to the spiritual side of life
and often have strongly held beliefs. Their strong value system often
means they can be rather judgmental of others. They are usually
tolerant but can find it difficult to accept people they see as
superficial or insincere.  
 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs often say they like observing people from a distance before
deciding whether they want to get to know them better.  Even then,
INFJs have to trust someone a lot before they really open up. Most say
they only have a few very good friends and that even people close to
them still find them "mysterious".  
 
<br/>
<br/>

As Js they find it easy to keep their focus on organisation but like
all NJ types their lack of attention to practical detail can mean
their organisation falls apart slightly at the seams. They could
misread their diary, for example, or pick up the wrong documents. 
 
<br/>
<br/>

Harmony is generally important for INFJs and they will often try to
avoid conflict at all costs. This can sometimes lead to greater
conflict however as by failing to deal with problems in a timely and
direct manner they can often escalate. INFJs can be very courageous
and will be prepared to provoke conflict if any of their fundamental
values are violated by others. They will not stand by and watch others
mistreating people, for example.  
 
<br/>
<br/>

INFJs can give out mixed messages to others. On the surface, they come
over as people who have a great need for harmony and co-operation. But
deep down they often have a greater need to pay attention to their own
very individualistic vision. Sometimes this can be so strong that they
will not listen to others' views. In these instances they can seem
determined to the point of being stubborn. They may also appear out of
touch.  
 
<br/>
<br/>

Ultimately it is important for INFJs to keep their intuition within
useful bounds. They must come to see that their inner vision is not
always right. It can be overly abstract and impractical and not take
adequate account of "real politic". They can often become more
effective if they subject their ideas and vision to other people's
views, particularly people with a preference for sensing and thinking.

Common relationship Issues for INFJs

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs show caring by noticing what would be of help and support to
someone.  This may be practical but can also be linked to that
person's personal or sprititual development.

<br/>
<br/>

INTJs and INFJs do not suffer from the same degree of indecision when
it comes their beliefs and identity as INPs. Their dominant function,
Introverted Intuition (Ni), confers a greater sense of closure and
conviction. Unlike Ne, which produces an endless stream of options,
Ni, somewhat paradoxically, can act quite convergently, functioning
more like a judging function. INJs often report having a gut feeling
(i.e., intuition) and strong sense of conviction about what is true
and what they believe.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are among the rarest of the sixteen personality types,
constituting only 1-3% of the general population. Unlike INTJs, in
which males predominate, there is greater gender parity among INFJs,
with nearly equal numbers of males and females. 

<br/>
<br/>

It is difficult to broadly classify INFJs as either right-brained or
left-brained since they utilize both sides of the brain with equal
adeptness. INFJs are both creative and responsible, artistic and
logical, spiritual and scientific, intuitive and analytic. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs grow up feeling "different" from their peers. The more
pronounced their Introversion and Intuition, the more estranged they
are likely to feel. Young INFJs also feel misunderstood by their
elders, who can be quick to ignore or dismiss their precocious
insights and observations. If given unsympathetic circumstances, INFJs
may come to feel isolated or rejected rather early in life. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are "old souls." They grow up feeling far wiser than would be
predicted by their chronological age. Some may experience themselves
as wiser than their teachers or parents. They may take on the role of
counseling and advising their friends and siblings, or even their
adult family members, from an extraordinarily young age. 

<br/>
<br/>

Having discovered the benefits of their Introverted Intuition (Ni)
quite early in life, INFJs grow to trust its judgments and
insights. Their Ni often works through dreams or premonitions that
turn out to be startlingly prescient. While others may at first be
skeptical of INFJ's powers of insight or foresight, many will come to
see them as psychic or prophetic, or at least highly perceptive. 

<br/>
<br/>

Because of their strong powers of intuition, many INFJs report feeling
like aliens in the world. One INFJ described her experience as almost
a constant feeling of deja vu, since her Ni is constantly foreseeing
the future before it unfolds. Other INFJs report feelings of
disembodiment, as though their body is independently moving through
space while they watch from without. The fact is that many INFJs
experience the world and their bodies in radically different ways than
other types. It is therefore not uncommon for INFJs or others to
question their sanity. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs see two people in everyone. They see the public persona, the
outer shell, that everyone else sees. But they don't stop there. Their
Se and Fe functions pick up subtle non-verbal cues which are then
synthesized and interpreted by their Ni. This provides them with
information about an individual's inner world that is completely
missed by other types. Because of their keen perceptiveness, INFJs are
rarely fooled by facades or fakery. They can readily see beyond
appearances and apprehend an individual's deeper motives and
intentions, including any underlying ego issues. In fact, INFJs can
often see the truth about people more clearly than those people can
see it in themselves. It is no wonder that many INFJs can make a
decent living by hanging a "Psychic" sign on their front door. 

<br/>
<br/>

Growing out of their distrust of first-blush appearances, INFJs are
reluctant to trust majority opinion. They are often the last to read a
bestseller, feeling that if everyone else (i.e., the majority of whom
are prone to being fooled by appearances) thinks it is good, it
probably is not worth their time. Like INTs, however, INFJs can be
suckers for a good conspiracy theory, appealing to their sense that
"most things are not what they seem." 

<br/>
<br/>

A misconception about INFJs is that because they prefer Feeling they
are less likely to be interested in intellectual endeavors. Nothing
could be farther from the truth. In fact, some of the most
intellectually-inclined people I know are INFJs. They rival and
resemble INTs in their level of openness and hunger for new ideas and
perspectives. In some regards, they may actually eclipse INTs with
regard to intellectual openness, readily appreciating both science and
literature, fiction and nonfiction, poetry and prose. 

<br/>
<br/>

While INFJs are deeply theoretical, they are less impressed by
theories built by a mere assemblage of facts or data. Rather than
being "fact" oriented, INFJs concern themselves with forging new
connections and reconciling opposites by way of their Intuition. They
feel that everything is somehow connected to everything else, forming
a vast and interconnected web. For INFJs, discovering truth involves
getting a better handle on the nature of this connectedness and the
holographic patterns of the universe. In fact, this happens to be one
of the signature strengths of their Ni, which subconsciously processes
and synthesizes copious amounts of information, wraps it up in the
form of a symbol or metaphor, and proceeds to upload into the INFJ's
consciousness. 

<br/>
<br/>

More than any other type, INFJs tend to feel that much of their
intellectual work is being done for them, the product of which can
feel like nothing less than a divinely bestowed gift. Consequently,
INFJs do not feel the need to consult outside sources when it comes to
discerning truth. Nor do they rely on a preexisting method or
framework as other types might. They trust their Ni to provide
whatever information is necessary to understand a given problem or
situation. 

<br/>
<br/>

The inner world of INFJs in many ways resembles the outer world of
ENFPs. It is playful, colorful, mischievous, and daring. Because their
Ni is dominant rather than auxiliary, INFJs tend to be more subversive
in their ideation than ENFJs. Once they begin to develop their
tertiary function (Ti), INFJs may become even more open-minded and
subversive in their thinking. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs often think by way of images. The visual nature of their minds
is germane to their creativity, ingenuity, and ability to generate and
wield metaphors. While other types are thinking in words or concepts,
INFJs understand through "seeing." Their Ni functions as a proverbial
bridge between the conscious and subconscious mind. And since the
subconscious is filled with primitive images, INFJs swim in a sea of
vivid dreams and imagery. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs also tend to be purists and classicists. Many enjoy collecting
antiques, historical artifacts, old first edition books, rare art, or
anything that satisfies their thirst for what they perceive as pure or
classic works. For similar reasons, they may find themselves
captivated by a certain period in history, a specific genre of music,
or a handpicked selection of actors or writers. In selecting a novel,
would far prefer a known classic to a new bestseller. Similarly, if
they are going to wear shoes (which according to recent research, most
INFJs do), they want the shoes to be of high quality and a classic,
rather than trendy style. If selecting artwork for display in their
home, they most would opt for an original over a print. 

<br/>
<br/>

Despite their refined tastes, INFJs are typically not pretentious or
excessively serious individuals. They regularly enjoy spending time
with other people, listening to music, and watching movies (especially
"classics"). Perhaps more than anything, INFJs love spending time
engrossed in meaningful conversation. Because of their verbosity (see
this post) and enjoyment of others' company, they can easily be
mistaken for Extraverts. 

<br/>
<br/>

Many INFJs struggle with bouts of depression, which may relate to any
number of things. They may, for instance, get depressed when they feel
their creative inspiration has left them. Or, because of their
otherworldliness, they may struggle with feeling deeply alone and
misunderstood. Depression may also stem from feeling dissatisfied in
their careers or relationships. They may dream of having a beautiful
home adorned with beautiful things, but feel stuck in a low-paying job
that they are reluctant to quit because of a poor economy. 

<br/>
<br/>

An Overview of Extraverted Feeling (Fe) in INFJs

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Intuition (Ni) is the dominant function for both INFJs and
INTJs. For an overview of its nature and workings, see this post. 

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Feeling (Fe) is INFJs' auxiliary function. One element of
Fe involves meeting others' needs and maintaining harmony in the
external environment. It works to ensure that everyone is getting
along and is well taken care of, that everything is running as
smoothly and seamlessly as possible. 

<br/>
<br/>

Fe types (i.e., FJs) focus much of their time and energy on social,
moral, or humanitarian concerns, with special concern for their family
and closest friends. They are often conceived as self-sacrificing,
deferring their own needs for the sake of the collective good. SFJs,
in particular, tend to enjoy the role of homemaker, working to ensure
their families are healthy and well-supported. 

<br/>
<br/>

Fe plays a role in perceiving and empathizing with others'
emotions. It helps INFJs intuitively recreate another's emotion state
within themselves. This allows them to know from within what another
person is experiencing. This ability to profoundly empathize with
others allows INFJs to understand and counsel people more effectively
than any other type. 
<br/>
<br/>


Interestingly, INFJs have a more difficult time when it comes to
perceiving and understanding their own emotions. This is due to the
fact that their Feeling function is directed outwardly (i.e.,
extraverted) rather than inwardly. Unlike INFPs, INFJs don't spend a
great deal of time trying to sort out their emotions. Inwardly, they
deal in the currency of Intuition (Ni) and Thinking (Ti). Hence, when
INFJs find themselves in emotionally taxing circumstances, they often
turn to others for support or direction. So while INFJs are extremely
gifted at helping others solve their problems, they can have greater
difficulty when it comes to navigating their own. 

<br/>
<br/>

Fe also entails an extraversion of judgment. INFJs utilize their Fe to
express their thoughts, feelings, opinions, and grievances. Fe gives
form and definition to INFJs' intuitions. In many cases, INFJs do not
know fully understand what their Ni is telling them until they are
given the opportunity to verbalize it. They may have a hunch or a gut
feeling, but the content of the intuition remains somewhat nebulous
until it is expressed via their Fe. Assuming they have not been
severely censored in their upbringing or past relationships, INFJs are
typically undeterred from extraverting their feelings. As mentioned
earlier, they can be highly talkative. If given the opportunity, they
will talk at great length on any number of subjects. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs' Fe can present differently among strangers than it does with
their intimates. In larger groups, INFJs can seem cheerier and warmer
as part of their attempt to ensure external harmony. Many INFJs have a
great sense of humor and can be incredibly funny and
engaging. Enlisting their vivid imaginations and knack for metaphor,
they can be gifted entertainers and storytellers. In the company of
close confidants, however, INFJs use their Fe to be more open and
direct with their emotions. Since some INFJs feel like tortured souls,
their commentary may take on a characteristically negative tone. They
may seem moody, pessimistic, discontented, or restless. They can also
seem quite intense in their communication since their words are
infused with the emotion of their Fe. Consequently, their expressions
may seem exaggerated, dramatic, or irrational, especially to Thinking
types. INFJs can also be susceptible to self-pity and self-loathing,
seeing themselves as victims. They may curse the fact that life isn't
fair, feeling that they always end up with the short end of the
stick. Such negative attitudes are more common among INFJs who are no
longer living in the mode of naive idealism, as well as those who have
not found a satisfying career or relationship. Despite what may seem a
penchant for complaining or forecasting doom, INFJs exemplify what it
means to be open and forthright. As one INFJ put it, "I don't know how
not to be honest." This is why INFJs are constantly championing
authenticity, since authentic expression by why of their Fe is their
most natural mode of operation. 

<br/>
<br/>

For INFJs, expressing themselves through their Fe is critical to their
psychological and physical health and well-being. Even if doing so
does not provide them with immediate solutions to the problem at hand,
they tend to feel better once they have expressed their feelings,
whether through words or tears. This is especially important for the
mates or friends of INFJs to recognize. Namely, INFJs are usually not
looking for others to solve their problem, but only to offer support,
empathy, and reassurance. Without such an outlet, INFJs can begin to
feel isolated and depressed, turning to their inner fantasy world as a
means of escape. And while fantasizing may seem helpful in the
short-term, it usually makes the real world seem even less tolerable
and can exacerbate existing frustrations toward life. 

<br/>
<br/>

Self (Ni) vs Others (Fe); Truth (Ni) vs Harmony (Fe)

<br/>
<br/>

Even if not to the same extent as EFJs, INFJs can be warm, welcoming,
and endearing. They genuinely want to please and help others, working
to ensure that people are getting along and are well cared for. They
tend to be loyal, giving, and self-sacrificing. At the same time,
however, INFJs are forward-thinking, goal-oriented, and
independent-minded. As Introverts, they need time to themselves to
recharge their proverbial batteries. This creates an ongoing, even
lifelong, struggle for INFJs. Namely, trying to balance their own
needs, values, and desires against those of others. 

<br/>
<br/>

For example, an INFJ may be asked by a friend or relative to donate
money to a cause that she may not truly believe in. This puts the INFJ
in a very difficult position, being forced to decide between her own
ideas about truth (Ni) and the harmony of the relationship (Fe). Since
INFJs can having enormous difficulty saying no, they will often opt to
oblige others, even while inwardly regretting doing so. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs may experience similar issues in school. Those who are
especially precocious may be disposed to questioning the veracity of
what the teacher or other students are saying. They may also feel
compelled to criticize what they see as ineffective methods of
instruction or discipline. At the same time, however, INFJs want to
please the teacher and to maintain external harmony. This again leaves
them feeling torn between allegiance to their Ni penchant for truth
versus their Fe people-pleasing. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs may also feel that their Fe interferes with their ability to be
self-disciplined. An INFJ writer and friend once suggested that her Fe
seems to work contrary to her dominant Ni and tertiary Ti. She felt
that INTP writers, for instance, can more easily devote time to
writing because their top three functions (Ti-Ne-Si) tend to work
together in a harmonious and mutually-supportive fashion. INFJs,
however, because of their Fe, can find it harder to prioritize their
personal ambitions over their relationships. 

<br/>
<br/>

Because of the strength of their Fe, INFJs need to be careful not to
abandon their Ni in the face of outward pressures. Too many outside
voices can at times obscure INFJs' typically clear vision. Since their
Ni is their best and most reliable compass for navigating life, when
they lost track of it, INFJs will inevitably feel lost, restless, and
frustrated. Hence, when making decisions, INFJs are wise to ensure
they are listening primarly to their own inner voice. 

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Intuition (Ni) & Extraverted Sensing (Se)

<br/>
<br/>

In addition to the tug-of-war between their Ni and Fe functions, INFJs
also struggle to reconcile their Ni with their inferior function,
Extraverted Sensing (Se). While Ni is the most otherworldly,
idealistic, and abstract of the functions, Se is arguably the most
"worldly" and action-oriented. 

<br/>
<br/>

As I discuss here, the inferior function opposes the dominant, is
largely subconscious, and in many ways has its own agenda. Its needs
and values are contrary to those of the dominant function, creating a
psychoemotional tug-of-war between the conscious and subconscious
mind. 

<br/>
<br/>

Like other types, INFJs tend to identify most strongly with their top
two functions and can be blind to the degree to which their inferior
Se impacts choices and behavior. It is therefore imperative that INFJs
develop an awareness and understanding of their Se so as to avoid
falling victim to its mischievous and insidious antics. We will now
consider three ways in which this Ni-Se tug-of-war manifests in
INFJs. 

<br/>
<br/>

1. Perfectionism.

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs have a reputation for being the strongest perfectionists of all
the personality types. Their perfectionistic bent makes sense in light
of their functional stack, with their Ni supplying the vision and
their Fe/Se wanting to see it actualized. 

<br/>
<br/>

To actualize an Ni ideal, INFJs must find a way to translate it into
tangible reality (Se). Unfortunately, INFJs commonly find that the
idealistic visions spawned in their lush inner landscape may be slow
to take root in the rocky soils of reality. The disparity between
their inner ideal (Ni) and the challenges of its outward
implementation can be deeply disappointing and disheartening for
INFJs. Because of the strength of their idealism, many INFJs struggle
to feel satisfied with anything less than a perfect replica of their
initial vision. What others view as a success, an INFJ may consider an
abject failure. 

<br/>
<br/>

In struggling to reconcile their ideals with the likelihood of a less
than perfect outcome, INFJs have two primary options. The first is to
act as mere producers of ideals without concerning themselves with
their actualization. This option may satisfy their Ni, but often fails
to deliver the tangible evidence of outer change (Se) INFJs'
desire. Nonetheless, when faced with the alernative of accepting a
less than ideal outcome, many INFJs will settle for this mode of
operation, at least for a while. This may be why INFJs go into
education, research, or ministry, careers that allow them to generate
or convey ideas without immediate concern for their
implementation. Writing and other artistic pursuits also provide INFJs
with opportunities to express their ideals without concern for their
direct application. 

<br/>
<br/>

The second option for reconciling the ideal with the actual is
actively working to implement their ideas while trying to accept
something less than perfection. This option may appease their Se
desire for a tangible product but can be incredibly frustrating to
their Ni idealism. Taking this route also introduces a new set of
concerns. Namely, once the Ni ideal has been tarnished, at what point
is the Se product no longer "good enough?" This is a question INFJs
must constantly face in both their work and relationships. They are
forced to grapple with whether their work or relationship is
acceptable, or if it is time to cut their losses and start over. If
they do opt to call it quits, they will again be faced with their
original dilemma of whether they should even bother to dirty their
hands in Se affairs. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are harder on themselves than they are on anyone else. Their Fe
makes INFJs more than willing to forgive the offenses and shortcomings
of others. But since they see themselves as more insightful and wise
when it comes to human behavior, they rarely grant themselves the same
degree of grace. They figure that if they are unable to perfectly
embody their theories and ideals, then why should they expect anyone
else to. And if their ideals have no chance of being actualized, then
why even bother? Without the ability to maintain hope in their ideals,
INFJs may feel they have no reason for living. This is why it feels so
important for them to act perfectly. This notion is well-captured in
the words of Jesus: But the one who does not know and does things
deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who
has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has
been entrusted with much, much more will be asked." (Luke 12:48, NIV)
INFJs know they have been entrusted with much, so they expect much
more from themselves than they do from others. 

<br/>
<br/>

Non-NJ types inevitably have difficulty understanding the degree and
intractability of INFJs' perfectionism. Dominant Thinking types, in
particular, struggle to understand why INFJs simply cannot restructure
their thoughts in a more rational way (e.g., cognitive-behavioral or
rational-emotive approaches) so as to avoid the host of undesirable
side-effects of perfectionism. What these individuals fail to
understand is that perfectionism does NOT feel like a choice for NFJs,
for whom Intuition (Ni) and Feeling (Fe) precede Thinking (Ti) in
their functional stack. When INFJs try to reorder their stack,
injecting Ti between Ni and Fe, they tend to feel worse. While Ti, as
we soon discuss, can be helpful for INFJs to see things more clearly
in retrospect, other types should not expect INFJs to always function
"rationally" in the moment. INFJs need to first give extraverted form
to their intuitions and feelings by way of their Fe without concerning
themselves with the degree of rationality (they trust their Intuition
to get them close to the truth). Then, with time, the INFJ can work
through the issue, including incorporating their Ti, and with any
luck, eventually arrive at a place of peace (Se). Problems arise,
however, when others do not allow the INFJ to self-express without
censorship or pressure to sound entirely rational. 

<br/>
<br/>

The great degree of pressure INFJs impose on this themselves, combined
with a lack of awareness to their own physicality, can make them
susceptible to a number of physical ailments that are
psychoemotionally driven. In his book, The Mind-Body Prescription,
Dr. John Sarno reports that the vast majority of his chronic pain
patients are perfectionists with a strong need to be good and to
please other people. Sarno believes that the guilt, anger, and
frustration associated with perfectionism lies at the root of any
number of bodily ailments. According to Sarno, perfectionists commonly
suffer from chronic pain, stomach problems, and other health
conditions. 

<br/>
<br/>

In closing this section, I would like to clarify that INFJs'
perfectionism typically does not extend to all facets of their
lives. More often than not, it is limited to those areas they really
care about. While ESJs tend to be highly concerned with the order of
their immediate environment, INFJs tend to be more focused on their
own behavior, the quality of their relationships, and the quality of
their chosen work. 

<br/>
<br/>

2. Love-Hate Relationship with the Material World & Conventional
Lifestyles 

<br/>
<br/>

Like INTJs, INFJs have a love-hate relationship with material
things. Because of their Se aesthetic bent, INFJs love to be ensconced
in beautiful surroundings, be they natural or man-made. They tend to
be captivated by the finer things in life, including the allure of
affluent lifestyles. Not only do they love the pretty things that
money can buy, but also the experiences. INFJs love to travel, to
attend the opera or symphony, or to savor a fine meal. 

<br/>
<br/>

Despite their love for the material treasures and pleasures the world
has to offer, INFJs have a commensurate need to discount or downplay
the importance of "things" in their lives. After all, INFJs tell
themselves that they are supposed to be concerned with the
metaphysical (Ni) rather than the physical (Se). They are quick to
criticize Sensing types for their materialism while surreptitiously
envying them for having it. This tug-of-war between their dominant N
and inferior S often surfaces when making decisions about careers or
relationships. The INFJ may struggle with choosing a job or partner
that promises material security (S) versus one that aligns more
closely with their N ideals. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs' need to see themselves as unique and unconventional also plays
into this struggle. Some may balk at the idea of marriage and
children, for instance, seeing this as the path for less reflective S
types. At the same time, INFJs envy S types who seem happy and
generally content with their lot in life. This love-hate relationship
is representative of the struggle INFJs have within themselves, the
battle between their dominant and inferior function. 

<br/>
<br/>

In their weaker moments, INFJs can get caught up in the grip of their
Se. Like INTJs, even the most responsible INFJs may suddenly throw
caution to the wind and turn to thrill seeking. They may turn to
drugs, alcohol, sex, extravagant vacations, or shopping binges to
indulge their Se. To guard against such extremes of their inferior,
INFJs may feel compelled to impose stingent rules on their behavior in
attempt to preserve their physical, mental, and/or material
well-being. 

<br/>
<br/>

3. Planning & Controlling (Ni-Fe) vs Letting Go & Embracing the Moment
(Se) 

<br/>
<br/>

From a very young age, INFJs enjoy envisioning and planning things. An
INFJ friend of mine apprised me of her childhood propensity for
constantly creating games or plays. After birthing her creations, she
would enlist her friends as actors while she functioned as the
director. Adult INFJs are no different. They love imagining an ideal
and formulating plans for its actualization. However, because they are
perfectionists and are not as gifted as S types when it comes to
acting, the process of actualizing their ideals often produces immense
frustration for INFJs. 

<br/>
<br/>

We previously discussed two options that INFJs might employ in
navigating the Ni-Se problem. A third option is for them to live in
the moment. Typically this is not a viable option for INFJs until
later in their development. Since Se is their inferior function, they
must first differentiate and develop their other three
functions. INFJs "live in the moment" when they forgo their desire to
constantly dream, fantasize, and plan for the future.  Instead, they
take each new day as it comes, trying to savor it for all it is
worth. In doing so, they are not opting for a hedonistic lifestyle. In
fact, this may not involve much of a change outer behavior at
all. Instead, it involves a shift in perspective. This seems as viable
a way as any for INFJs to marry the N and the S. Through a change in
perspective (N) they can learn to enjoy the simple pleasures of being
and existing (S) that they often ignored or glutted themselves on
previously. 
 
<br/>
<br/>

As INFJs develop their Se, they begin to see ways their Ni and Se can
be at peace with one another. They realize that lasting fulfillment
cannot arise from fantasizing about or trying to control the
future. Rather than always seeing the world as flawed, problem-ridden,
and in need of modification, INFJs, through a shift in perspective,
can begin to see the world and its workings as already beautiful. This
is not to say that they will no longer make moral judgments, but only
that they will be tempered by a degree of acceptance and appreciation
for what is (Se). While INFJs are born with a drive to passionately
change the world, they can also learn to love the world as it is. They
learn to loosen their grip on life, negotiating what can often be a
fine balance between embracing and releasing it. 

<br/>
<br/>

Admittedly, negotiating a treaty between their Ni and Se does not
happen overnight. When INFJs first experiment with a "live in the
moment" mindset it can often feel insipid and meaningless. They may
feel that all their grand dreams and plans have been in vain and they
may feel left with what amounts to an overly ordinary sort of
existence. This can, and often does, invoke a fear response in INFJs,
who are prone to panic in the face of any sign that they might be
becoming "ordinary." Hence, INFJs may spend long periods of time
dabbling and experimenting with "living in the moment" before settling
on a mode of living that seems to honor and incorporate both their Ni
and Se. 

<br/>
<br/>

Typology guru Naomi Quenk has written an excellent book, Was That
Really Me, which further illustrates the role of the inferior function
in the Myers-Briggs personality types: 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs' Tertiary Function: Introverted Thinking (Ti) 

<br/>
<br/>

The role of Ti in INFJs is to open and further refine their Fe
judgments.It adds an element of skepticism and logic that is less
apparent in their earlier development. For instance, INFJs who grew up
in a religious home may initially interpret their own wisdom and
insights through the lens of that particular faith tradition. As they
develop their Ti, they may come to question whether their wisdom might
not be better understood in psychological rather than religious
terms. They may also come to see their insights as ubiquitous and
available to those of all faiths rather than being limited to any one
tradition. 

<br/>
<br/>

Less developed INFJs may see little need to use or develop their
Ti. Since their Intuition provides them with strong feedback about
what is or isn't true, taking an additional step to Ti may seem
unnecessary. With time and maturity, however, INFJs grow increasingly
more comfortable with their Ti and come to recognize and appreciate
its inherent value. Ti helps INFJs think more critically and
analytically, acts as an aid and check to their Ni-Fe, and helps them
discern where their ideas might fit into existing categories and
frameworks of knowledge. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs who have honed their Ti can work side-by-side with Thinking
types, capable of analyzing and classifying their theories according
to the objective standards of a given field.  Such individuals are
often drawn to academia, research, or scholarship, making scientists,
philosophers, and scholars of the highest order. 

<br/>
<br/>

What INFJs may perceive as a negative or difficult feature of their Ti
is its tendency to generate self-doubt. As Ti butts up against the
insights offered by their Ni, INFJs may temporarily distrust their
most cherished and utilized mode of knowing-their Intuition. But
personal growth is never easy, not for any type. With time, INFJs
settle into a healthy balance between their Ni and Ti, intuitively
knowing how to apply their Ti without spoiling the delicious insights
proffered by their Intuition. 

<br/>
<br/>

A Penchant for Solving Human Problems

<br/>
<br/>

As mentioned earlier, INFJ are masters when it comes to reading people
and their motives. The Ni/Fe/Se combination, whether occurring in
INFJs or ENFJs, is adept at detecting and interpreting human
emotions. Not only are INFJs adept a surveying and reading emotions,
but they are highly skilled at solving people-related problems. 

<br/>
<br/>

When it comes to people and humanitarian issues, INFJs typically feel
they have answers, or at least have the capacity to generate
one. INFJs feel that in order to solve the myriad humanitarian crises
facing the world, we must first gain a better foothold on the
fundamentals of human nature and human behavior. We need to better
understand ourselves - our motives, behaviors, and personality. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs often feel happiest and most fulfilled when helping others solve
their problems. They also enjoy receiving new insights into people as
they going about helping them. INFJs are least content when they
become too caught up in themselves and their own personal
grievances. This is why healthy relationships and/or a well-suited
career are so vital to INFJs' satisfaction. If they feel bored or
stagnated in their work or relationships, they have been known to
engage in destructive behaviors to produce a problem to solve. 

<br/>
<br/>

Because of their love for proferring advice and solving people-related
problems, INFJs are commonly drawn to careers such as ministry,
counseling, and teaching. Others may opt to work toward social change
in politics or non-profit work.

Creativity & Metaphor

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs may well be the most profoundly creative of all types. When
engrossed in creative flow, they experience themselves in perfect
synchrony with the universe. Some have described this as a trance, an
altered state of consciousness in which they morph into a vessel of
creative energy. Others have likened it to divine inspiration or being
visited by muses. Such metaphors speak to the power of the creative
process for INFJs. When engrossed in a creative stint, they may write
for hours, occasionally even days, without rest. They may feel that,
should they stop, they will lose out on the wealth of insights that
are effortlessly flowing through them. 

<br/>
<br/>

Metaphor, the primary offspring of a fertile Ni, is INFJs'
bread-and-butter tool for communication, allowing them illustrate
their ideas in an easy-to-swallow format. In contrast to INTs' bent
toward linguistic parsimony, INFJs prefer to dress up their ideas,
invigorating and embellishing them with descriptive metaphors. It is
interesting to note the degree to which Se details shows up in their
verbiage; INFJs not only want others to see their point, but to hear
it, feel it, taste it, and smell it. A good INFJ friend of mine and
student of the culinary arts cannot help but use food metaphors on a
routine basis. 

<br/>
<br/>

Although INFJs are commonly drawn to music, visual arts, design, or
architecture, writing may well be this type's signature creative
talent. Adept at channeling their right-brain creativity into a fluid
and engaging left-brain storyline, INFJs are unmatched in their feel
for and creative use of the written word. Since writing is largely an
intuitive enterprise, INFJs who can readily access their Ni muses can
enjoy a great advantage in this particular craft.

[For INFJs] it's a good idea to be selfish (gasp!) and get in touch
with your interests, your values, your needs.  Don't think about an
occupation -- think about an occu-passion!  And ironically, this can
be one of the most difficult things for an INFJ to do, given that our
introverted Feeling (the function that knows what we the individual
want) shows up in 6th position in our function hierarchy.  That
configuration creates a handicap which must be consciously overcome in
order to obtain optimum work satisfaction.  If INFJs don't overcome
it, it's all too easy for them to become "people-pleasers" and attempt
to have the career their mother wants for them, or a favorite teacher,
or their girlfriend.  They might even take a "job" to get by in order
to support somebody else's aspirations.  It's vital for INFJs to act
just a little bit "selfish" about pursuing work that is personally
fulfilling, and not try to make somebody else happy. That may satisfy
you for a while, but it will eventually grow stale, and then
disappointment will come hard on its heels -- disappointment that you
didn't fulfill your purpose on this earth.

<br/>
<br/>

Real success is finding your life work in the work that you love. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFJs are often satisfied with too little -- as long as they are being
catalysts, they may feel that is enough.  As a result, they sometimes
get drafted into others' agendas and supporting others toward success.
(I found I had to work with a coach to keep me true to myself and not
automatically sell out to outer demands on me.  It is soo seductive to
fall into a supportive role.)
