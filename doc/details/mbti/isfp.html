<h3>ISFP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/isfp.html

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are the first to hear the different drummer. Many eagerly plunge
into new fashions, avant garde experiences, 'hip' trends--some even
setting the trends.

<br/>
<br/>

More in touch with the reality of their senses than their INFP
counterparts, ISFPs live in the here and now. Their impulses yearn to
be free, and are often loosed when others least expect it. The ISFP
who continually represses these impulses feels 'dead inside' and may
eventually cut and run. (One ISFP friend has become nonambulatory
within the past few years. He will still, on impulse, leave home in
the middle of the night and go to Las Vegas or wherever, regardless of
the difficulties of his physical condition.)

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs may be quite charming and ingratiating on first acquaintance,
flowing with compliments which may (or may not) be deserved. On other
occasions, the same individual may be aloof and detached. Some ISFP
males are fiercely competitive, especially in sport or table games,
and may have great difficulty losing. This competitive nature, also
seen in other SP types, sometimes fosters 'lucky,' 'gut' feelings and
a willingness to take risks.

<br/>
<br/>

Organized education is difficult for the majority of ISFPs, and many
drop out before finishing secondary education. Their interest can be
held better through experiential learning, at which many excel. ISFPs
will practice playing an instrument or honing a favored skill for
hours on end, not so much as practice as for the joy of the
experience.

<br/>
<br/>

Differential diagnosis:

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are less fantasy-oriented than INFPs. These types are often
confused, however, INFPs lean strongly to daydreams, poetry, prose and
more philosophical pursuits; ISFPs often live out 'id' experiences
rather than writing or even talking about them.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFJs are driven by the conventional, by 'should's and 'ought's; ISFPs
internalize their Feeling (by nature a judging function) which bursts
out spontaneously and leaves as quickly and mysteriously as it came.

<br/>
<br/>

Because of these variant expressions of Feeling judgement, ISFPs are
sometimes confused with ESFJs, but keep themselves more aloof, more
often concealing the feelings that ESFJs are so apt to expose.

<br/>
<br/>

ESFPs express thoughts more readily (and, in the main,
skillfully). ISFPs can and do perform admirably in the spotlight, but
generally have little to say about the performance. For example, few
ISFPs would be disc-jockeys, a field strongly represented by ES_Ps.
 
<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis:

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling

<br/>
<br/>

Feeling, unbridled by the external forces of society and substance, is
the dominant function. ISFPs spontaneously develop their own codes and
credos, about which they are quite sober and intense. ISFPs are
questors, driven to find the pure and ideal, as personally and
individually defined. Feeling may temporarily turn outward, but cannot
be long sustained beyond its cloistered home.

<br/>
<br/>

If the individual has values greater than herself, feeling may express
itself in valiant acts of selflessness. Turned in upon self, however,
it becomes an unscrupulous, capricious enigma, capable even of heinous
acts of deception and treachery.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Sensing

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs keep a finger on the pulse of here and now. They are more adept
at doing than considering, at acting than reflecting, at tasting than
wondering. As do most SPs, ISFPs keenly sense color, sound, texture,
and movement. It is not unusual for ISFPs to excel in sensory, motor,
or kinesthetic abilities.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs cherish their impulses. Some of the most beautiful, graceful,
and artistic performances are the result of this drive for physical,
sensate expression.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted iNtuition

<br/>
<br/>

Tertiary intuition works best in the background of the ISFP's inner
world. Perhaps this is the source of the "gut feeling" SPs consult in
matters of chance. However "lucky" the ISFP may be, intuition as a
means of communication is a poor servant, evidenced in spoonerisms,
and non sequiturs and mixed metaphors.

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

The ISFP may employ Extraverted Thinking in external situations
requiring closure. As is the case with inferior functions, such
Thinking behaves in an all or nothing manner. Thus, as with other FP
types, the ISFP's Extraverted Thinking is at risk for a lack of
context and proportion. In most cases, persons of this type enjoy
greater facility operating in the open-ended style of sensing,
implying the opinions of feeling values in the indirect fashion
characteristic of introverted functions.

<br/>

The Artist

<br/>
<br/>

As an ISFP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where
you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they
fit into your value system. Your secondary mode is external, where you
take things in via your five sense in a literal, concrete fashion.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs live in the world of sensation possibilities. They are keenly in
tune with the way things look, taste, sound, feel and smell. They have
a strong aesthetic appreciation for art, and are likely to be artists
in some form, because they are unusually gifted at creating and
composing things which will strongly affect the senses. They have a
strong set of values, which they strive to consistently meet in their
lives. They need to feel as if they're living their lives in
accordance with what they feel is right, and will rebel against
anything which conflicts with that goal. They're likely to choose jobs
and careers which allow them the freedom of working towards the
realization of their value-oriented personal goals.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs tend to be quiet and reserved, and difficult to get to know
well. They hold back their ideas and opinions except from those who
they are closest to. They are likely to be kind, gentle and sensitive
in their dealings with others. They are interested in contributing to
people's sense of well-being and happiness, and will put a great deal
of effort and energy into tasks which they believe in.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs have a strong affinity for aesthetics and beauty. They're likely
to be animal lovers, and to have a true appreciation for the beauties
of nature. They're original and independent, and need to have personal
space. They value people who take the time to understand the ISFP, and
who support the ISFP in pursuing their goals in their own, unique
way. People who don't know them well may see their unique way of life
as a sign of carefree light-heartedness, but the ISFP actually takes
life very seriously, constantly gathering specific information and
shifting it through their value systems, in search for clarification
and underlying meaning.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are action-oriented individuals. They are "doers", and are
usually uncomfortable with theorizing concepts and ideas, unless they
see a practical application. They learn best in a "hands-on"
environment, and consequently may become easily bored with the
traditional teaching methods, which emphasize abstract thinking. They
do not like impersonal analysis, and are uncomfortable with the idea
of making decisions based strictly on logic. Their strong value
systems demand that decisions are evaluated against their subjective
beliefs, rather than against some objective rules or laws.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are extremely perceptive and aware of others. They constantly
gather specific information about people, and seek to discover what it
means. They are usually penetratingly accurate in their perceptions of
others.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are warm and sympathetic. They genuinely care about people, and
are strongly service-oriented in their desire to please. They have an
unusually deep well of caring for those who are close to them, and are
likely to show their love through actions, rather than words.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs have no desire to lead or control others, just as they have no
desire to be led or controlled by others. They need space and time
alone to evaluate the circumstances of their life against their value
system, and are likely to respect other people's needs for the same.

<br/>
<br/>

The ISFP is likely to not give themself enough credit for the things
which they do extremely well. Their strong value systems can lead them
to be intensely perfectionist, and cause them to judge themselves with
unneccesary harshness.

<br/>
<br/>

The ISFP has many special gifts for the world, especially in the areas
of creating artistic sensation, and selflessly serving others. Life is
not likely to be extremely easy for the ISFP, because they take life
so seriously, but they have the tools to make their lives and the
lives of those close to them richly rewarding experiences.

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/>

Dominant: Introverted Feeling
<br/>
Auxilliary: Extraverted Sensing

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISFP

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to ISFPs as Composers, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Artisan. ISFPs account for about 5-10% of the
population.

<br/>
<br/>

I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: ISFPs tend to be quiet and
reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends
rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in
social situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).[6]
  
<br/>
<br/>

S - Sensing preferred to intuition: ISFPs tend to be more concrete
than abstract. They focus their attention on the details rather than
the big picture, and on immediate realities rather than future
possibilities .[7]
  
<br/>
<br/>

F - Feeling preferred to thinking: ISFPs tend to value personal
considerations above objective criteria. When making decisions, they
often give more weight to social implications than to logic.[8]
    
<br/>
<br/>

P - Perception preferred to judgment: ISFPs tend to withhold judgment
and delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open"
should circumstances change.[9]
  
<br/>
<br/>

Myers-Briggs description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Myers-Briggs, ISFPs are peaceful, easygoing people who
adopt a "live and let live" approach to life. They enjoy taking things
at their own pace and tend to live in the moment. Although quiet, they
are pleasant, considerate, and caring, devoted to the people in their
lives. Though not inclined to debate or necessarily even air their
views, their values are important to them.

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey description

<br/>
<br/>

According to Keirsey, Composer Artisans are grounded in the here and
now. They are extremely sensitive to their environment, attuned to the
perceptions of their five senses even more than other sensing types
are. They notice small variations in their physical world or in the
people around them. They are very sensitive to balance and understand
well what does or does not fit, whether in a work of art or any other
aspect of their lives. ISFPs are highly conscious of their companions,
but they prefer to allow others to direct their own lives. ISFPs tend
to be emotionally well rounded and empathetic toward others.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>


ISFPs direct their energy towards the inner world of thoughts and
emotions. They give importance to particular beliefs or opinions,
particularly those that relate to people that they know and current
experiences. They tend to take a caring and sensitive approach to
others.

<br/>
<br/>

What makes an ISFP tick?

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the judging one of Feeling. Characteristics associated with this function include:

<br/>
<br/>

    Makes decisions on the basis of personal values
<br/>
    Is appreciative and accepting of people - enjoying company and seeking harmony
<br/>
    Assesses the impact of decisions on others, being sympathetic or compassionate
<br/>
    Takes a personal approach 

<br/>
<br/>

The judging Feeling function is introverted. That is, Feeling is used
primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The ISFP
will therefore:

<br/>
<br/>

    * develop an inner emotional life that is often unseen to others, but is experienced as intense
<br/>
    * retain a strong sense of values, which are often not expressed
<br/>
    * emotionally accept or reject various aspects of life - for
    example, deciding whether praise or criticism received is valid
    and, at extreme, ignoring whatever is unacceptable
<br/>
    * feel appreciation towards others, but not express it 

<br/>
<br/>

The Feeling function is primarily supported by extraverted Sensing
perception, That is, Sensing perception is used primarily to manage
the outer world of actions and spoken words. This will modify the way
that the Feeling is directed, by:

<br/>
<br/>

    * focusing the (inner world) Feeling on current relationships and people, e.g.: through one-to-one discussions and fact-based conversation
<br/>
    * seeking to enjoy the company of those they know, and being concerned for their well-being and happiness
<br/>
    * helping people in practical ways 
<br/>

The classic temperament of an ISFP is Dionesian, or Sanguine, for whom freedom
from constraint is a basic driving force - seeking to enjoy the present.

<br/>
<br/>
Contributions to the team of an ISFP

<br/>
<br/>
In a team environment, the ISFP can contribute by:

<br/>
<br/>
    * solving problems as they arise, especially ones concerning people
<br/>
    * generating team spirit through promoting co-operation, and engendering a quiet sense of fun
<br/>
    * ensuring the well-being of team members
<br/>
    * being accurate and observant about facts, without putting too much interpretation on them
<br/>
    * modelling flexibility - e.g.: suggesting his/her own ideas, but being considerate of others points of view and going with the majority
<br/>
    * paying attention to the people side of the problem 
<br/>
<br/>

The potential ways in which an ISFP can irritate others include:

<br/>
<br/>

    * being too concerned with harmony in the group
<br/>
    * not pushing the ISFP's own ideas and contribution enough
<br/>
    * being stubborn over issues the group did not anticipate being a problem
<br/>
    * avoiding conflict and not giving forthright criticism when it is needed
<br/>
    * focusing so much on interpersonal issues that cost and other impersonal considerations are not adequately addressed
<br/>
    * perhaps failing to take a longer term view
<br/>
    * taking people at face value and not recognising underlying motives 

<br/>
<br/>

Personal Growth
<br/>
<br/>

As with all types, the ISFP can achieve personal growth by developing all
functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as:

<br/>
<br/>

    * being prepared to declare the ISFP's personal values
<br/>
    * interpreting the facts they observe to reveal hidden meanings
<br/>
    * undertaking a critical appraisal of a situation or person, and expressing disagreement or criticism when it could be of value to the recipient
<br/>
    * establishing a long term goal, developing a outline plan for achieving it, and working towards it
<br/>
    * listing options and undertaking a formal process of evaluation against criteria, including a cost benefit analysis 

<br/>
<br/>

Recognising Stress

<br/>
<br/>

As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the ISFP will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the ISFP might:

<br/>
<br/>

    * concentrate on what the ISFP sees as important
<br/>
    * work alone if possible
<br/>
    * act impulsively and take risks
<br/>
    * fail to consider the cost implications 

<br/>
<br/>

Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the ISFP's shadow may appear - a negative form of ENTJ. Example characteristics are:

<br/>
<br/>

    * being very critical and finding fault with almost everything
<br/>
    * becoming bossy and ignoring others' feelings
<br/>
    * having a very pessimistic view of the future
<br/>
    * see hidden meanings that are not really there 

<br/>
<br/>

The shadow is part of the unconscious that is often visible to others, onto whom
the shadow is projected. The ISFP may therefore readily see these faults in
others without recognising it in him/her self.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFP Relationships

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are warmhearted, gentle people who take their commitments seriously, and
seek lifelong relationships. They are very private people, who keep their true
feelings and opinions reserved or hidden from others. This may cause them to
constantly defer to their mates in their intimate relationships, which may cause
problems if their mates are not extremely aware of the ISFP's feelings. Some
ISFPs who are in the habit of not expressing their needs and feelings find
themselves in situations throughout their life where they feel overshadowed,
overlooked, or even "tread upon" by others. Highly practical and cynical by
nature, these feelings may cause the ISFP to become bitter, and to either give
up on their relationships, or to start using their relationships for their own
personal gain. Although this problem is observed sometimes in the ISFP type, it
does not seem to be present in those ISFPs who consistently express their
feelings to those closest to them. These ISFPs have a very positive, warm
outlook on life and love, and are not as likely to find themselves in
relationships where they are taken for granted or taken advantage of. ISFPs go
to great lengths to please their partners. They're very loyal and supportive,
with a deep capacity for love. They detest conflict and discord, and highly
value being seen and understood for who they are. They need space to live their
lives in their own unique way, and will respect other's need for space.

<br/>
<br/>


http://www.insightsforchange.co.uk/Hirsh-Kummerow/ISFP%20-%20The%20Aesthete.htm

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are gentle and compassionate, open and flexible. They are considerate of
others and do not force their views and opinions on them. They often focus on
meeting others' needs, especially those who are less fortunate. Having a quite,
modest, self-effacing style, ISFPs avoid disagreements and seek harmony with
people as well as with nature. They enjoy life's precious moments and often add
a touch of beauty to the environments where they spend their time. They are at
their best ensuing others' well-being.

<br/>
<br/>

Living

<br/>
<br/>

ISFP children are pleasant, quiet, and kind. Their talents may be easy to
overlook because they shun the spotlight and do not have a strong need to
demonstrate their strengths to others. They may be particularly drawn to people,
animals, and plants who need the gentle care that ISFPs provide.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFP children generally relate well with others and tend to have friends because
they are easy to like. They are interested in others's feelings and notice
particularly when disharmony exists. It is quite difficult for ISFPs to see
their friends in conflict with one another. When this occurs, they will try to
help ease the disagreements by playing the role of peacemaker.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFP children notice and attend to the delights of the senses. Often they will
make special gifts for people whom they particularly like. These gifts are
usually unique and original, with much attention paid to color, line, texture,
and form. They are often very conscious of the internal sensations in their
bodies. They tend to be aware of what their body will and will not do.

<br/>
<br/>

As teenagers, ISFPs may blend into the woodwork because they are quiet and
unassuming. They are oriented toward deeply felt personal values, and they may
find themselves on the outside of social groups if the groups do not share the
same values.

<br/>
<br/>

In adult life, ISFPs work quietly, often behind the scenes, helping individuals
meet their goals and dreams. They like a life of action and interaction, and
often choose careers that allow them to exercise their ability to see the needs
of the moment and respond quickly. They have little desire to impress others or
to impose their will. However, they can be gently and persistently persuasive if
they believe some action is in another's best interest.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs enjoy their friends and their families, and spend time nurturing their
relationships. They bring an air of spontaneity and easy acceptance to all they
meet and are rarely quickly judgmental. Only when people do something grossly
out of line will the anger of ISFPs surface. They will then stand firmly against
the infraction to support the victim.

<br/>
<br/>

Learning and Working

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs learn best through hands-on experience. They may not be as interested in
traditional academic subjects as some other types. They prefer application and
practicality rather than studying the theoretical and only potentially
useful. Making drawings, constructing miniature models, or using other direct
representations to master the subject matter are appealing activities for
them. They dislike structure and institutional settings that take away their
spontaneity and freedom. They want their learning to be relevant to what is
going on in their world. They have less patience with conceptual and abstract
learning.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs enjoy learning subjects that relate to helping and knowing about
people. They may be easily overlooked in the classroom unless the teacher has
recognized their special ways of learning and their unique
contributions. Encouragement helps draw out ISFPs.

<br/>
<br/>

At work, ISFPs contribute by attending to the practical facts relating to the
needs of people and all living things in their environments. They can infuse a
particular knod of joy into cooperative nature. Because they pay attention to
the humanistic aspects of the organization, they act in ways that ensure others'
well-being. People enjoy ISFPs because they bring understanding yet adaptability
to the realities of their work.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs enjoy occupations that allow them to be flexible and adaptable and to meet
the here-and-now needs of others. They enjoy responding to the moment and choose
work where they can offer practical, specific help in times of difficulty.

<br/>
<br/>

Some occupations are more appealing to ISFPs: Bookkeeper, carpenter, personal
service worker, clerical supervisor and secretary, dental and medical staffers,
food service worker, nurse, mechanic, physical therapist, X-ray technician, and
other occupations that allow them to provide gentle help to all living things.

<br/>
<br/>

Loving

<br/>
<br/>

For the ISFP, love means devotion, loyalty, care, humor, and consideration for
the needs and wants of the loved one. When ISFPs first fall in love, they may
feel consumed by it. They may become naive and focus entirely on the romance of
it - 'falling in love with love.' Future worries are cast aside in favor of the
present realities. ISFPs may ignore all else in order to experience their love
life most fully. Doing this can leave them vulnerable to the whims of others.

<br/>
<br/>

Because being loved and cared for is important to ISFPs, they make sure that
relationships are nourished so that they can continue to grow. When They are in
love, they find a multitude of ways to show their affection and their
appreciation for the other person. Often ISFPs will go so far as to rearrange
their careers, start or stop working, move geographically, or make other changes
to maintain their relationships.

<br/>
<br/>

The friends, family members, and even pets of the ISFPs' partners become
important to them as well. ISFPs take it upon themselves to make their
environments places where there is the potential to have a harmonious existence
for all.

<br/>
<br/>

In their desire to please others, some ISFPs may not be confident enough to
speak up for themselves about what they need. If the relationship turns sour,
the ISFP may believe that it was caused by something that they personally
did. They may assume more of the blame than is necessary. When they are scorned,
they may retreat and repeatedly analyse the situation internally. When they do
face reality and finally let go, they can become more assertive and
self-directed in the resumption of their lives.

<br/>
<br/>

Profile by David Keirsey

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are found in about 6 percent of the general population. The best name for
this type is free spirit, for they have an intense need for freedom. The simple
rural life, life in the wilderness, the tribal/communal life-all these may call
them. Their need for social interaction, however, is not as great as that of the
type they most resemble, the ESFP. So an ISFP may forgo all social ties of any
duration to preserve the freedom to wander. The lyric, "I was born under a
wandering star...", might capture the spirit of the ISFP in this respect. The
flower children of the 1960's may have been largely ISFPs, though the ESFPs also
seem attracted to communing with others.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs also resemble INFPs in needing to achieve intensity of feeling. The focus,
however, with the ISFPs seems to be more on the sensuous side than the
meaningful side. The ISFP is orgastic, in the sense, demanding of life that it
provide the excitement and pleasure of drinking deeply at the Dionysian
well. Not revelry (that is the forte of the ESFP) but experience is what
attracts the ISFP to these kinds of activities. Music, like wine, is
incorporated and internalized, and the introverted nature of the ISFP requires
this internalization. There is a reason why the flower became the symbol for
what the flower children wanted: Flowers are warm, alive, sweet, colorful,
rhythmic, natural, absolute, needing no statement, no interpretation-a pure
being-in-self.

<br/>
<br/>

ISFPs are not articulate. They communicate through action. They do not verbalize
their meanings, but, for example, offer a lovely flower and a smile. Their
actions speak of the pastoral and the bucolic.

<br/>
<br/>

Career

<br/>
<br/>

They do not seek philosophy or science or literature. These are too distant from
life for the ISFPs. They seek, rather, the pounding surf, the river, the forest,
the ship, the truck, the racing car, the horse, the potter's wheel, the hoist,
the bulldozer-some kind of action where they can keep their fingers on the pulse
of life.

<br/>
<br/>

Home

<br/>
<br/>

It is not that people are unimportant to the ISFP-indeed they are-but people are
more the framework for the activities of the ISFP, providing a shadowy
background. Perhaps this type is the least understood of all the types-and yet
often the most envied. They are so fiercely independent and insistent that they
live in and for the moment, in action, fully savoring the urges they feel and
discharge, that others often find them difficult to comprehend or
understand. Gaugin, perhaps, provides a prototype of the ISFP as he walked away
from his affluent position in society, off to Tahiti to an unknown future, and
without a backward glance!

<br/>
<br/>

Midlife

<br/>
<br/>

At midlife ISFPs may be subject to strong temptation to follow Gaugin's lead, to
abandon their current style of life, and sacrifice home, children, and mate for
the lure of the unknown bucolic life. The cost of following this impulse must,
of course, be reckoned. If the ISFP has not found in work a source of pleasure
which continues past midlife, he or she may want to opt for an early retirement
and enter into a new career where their need to be close to nature can be
satisfied.

<br/>
<br/>

Mates

<br/>
<br/>

Pursuit of two themes-closeness to nature and artistic activity-places the ISFP
quite a distance from the utilitarian outlook. Yet it is precisely that outlook
that seems to attract the bucolic spirit. The opposite on the N side is the ENTJ
"fieldmarshal," the most militant of all types in his desire to run things. ISFP
is most likely to become a pacifist or environmentalist, and yet also is likely
to seek out the person who is temperamentally suited to tactical leadership,
military or otherwise. ISFP is likewise attracted to the ESTJ "administrator,"
the person temperamentally suited to be "in charge" of establishments. Note that
the person most likely to deprecate the establishment is attracted to the head
of an establishment. It is rather doubtful, should an ISFP actually marry an
ENTJ or ESTJ, that there is any intent or desire to change the spouse into a
pastoral. Of all types, ISFP is most likely to "let be" whoever or whatever. It
seems more likely that the latter provides a kind of anchorage to enterprise and
to civilization.
