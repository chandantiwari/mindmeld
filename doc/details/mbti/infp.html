<h3>INFP</h3>

From <i>Was That Really Me?</i>

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling types [INFP and ISFPs] are flexible, open,
complicated, mild, modest, and often self-effacing.Though difficult to
get to know, they are seen as trustworthy confidants who are tolerant
of a wide range of differences. Their habitual approach to people is
nonjudgmental, understanding, and forgiving.They place a high value on
affirming both their own and others' individuality and
uniqueness. They seek to affirm all parties in a controversy and thus
readily see the validity of contradictory points of view. Underlying
their characteristic tolerance is an overarching natural
curiosity.They find the diversity in the world immensely
appealing. ISFPs want to experience as much of the environment,
especially the natural environment, as possible; INFPs' desire for
broad experience, especially human experience, may be secondary to
their need to understand it. 

<br/>
<br/>

Both Introverted Feeling types may find it difficult to take a firm
stance on issues that are not centrally important to them. As a result, they
may see themselves and be seen by others as indecisive and lacking in
conviction. In matters in which they hold strong values, however, they
are firm and uncompromising in expressing and enacting their beliefs.
Introverted Feeling types focus on what is good in others, so they tend
to downplay others' faults, often forgiving them for slights or minor
hurtful behavior. At their best, they accept their own mistakes and
imperfections as well, achieving some success in maintaining the inner
harmony that is so important to them.

<br/>
<br/>

In crisis situations, they typically will hold back to see if others
will solve the problem competently.They are then content to follow
someone else's lead. But if adequate leadership is absent, ISFPs and
INFPs may assume a dominant role, acting swiftly, confidently, and
competently to handle the difficult situation.

<br/>
<br/>

Work is energizing for Introverted Feeling types when it enables them
to enact important values, especially by helping others grow and
develop as individuals.Their own growth and development is equally
important.Thus they flourish in an environment that offers the freedom
to complete projects within a flexible time frame and focuses more on
people than on the "bottom line." An ISFP said he was particularly
energized by "successfully completing a task or mission when I am
assisting someone else." An INFP is energized by "working one to one
with people, helping them discover themselves. "Having the freedom to
be creative in a relaxed atmosphere is important for both Introverted
Feeling types, but their respective auxiliary Sensing and Intuition
influence their preferred focus. ISFPs tend to enjoy accomplishing
concrete projects, such as "interesting, hands-on work that I know has
a purpose and gives me a sense of accomplishment" or "hands-on
materials, creating things, lack of boundaries." INFPs' auxiliary
Intuition emerges in a liking for innovation, particularly in the
context of helping people. The following description typifies
energizing work for INFPs: "growing and developing yourself and others
and creating new programs." INFPs generally find difficult tasks
appealing, while many ISFPs appreciate simplicity in their work
assignments. One INFP is energized by "doing something I enjoy that
is difficult but has the end result of being something productive and
helpful." Another expressed feeling energized "when I take on a hard
problem that can be solved in a new way that allows me to use my
creativity and feel as if I've done something."

<br/>
<br/>

Like their Extraverted Feeling counterparts, Introverted Feeling types
may be concerned about their intellectual abilities, often viewing
others, particularly Thinking types, as smarter and more knowledgeable
than themselves. Because they are likely to be somewhat uneasy about
their skill in logical analysis, they tend to be hypersensitive to
illogic, dishonesty, and inaccuracy in others. They are quick to
detect insincerity or phoniness, and they readily take offense when
faced with the hyperbole typical of television commercials and
candidates running for political office. One INFP who hated magic
shows and card tricks gave as her reason for this her dislike of
"being fooled."

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling types also may be somewhat disdainful of people
who act quickly on the basis of insufficient information, seeing their own
careful, reflective, and restrained approach to problem solving as
inherently better. They may be quick to point out the errors made or
opportunities missed by people who reach conclusions hastily.

<br/>
<br/>

Projection of the inferior function is revealed in a readiness to
notice and comment on mistakes made by others." I start noticing that
there are an unusual number of rude and incompetent drivers on the
highway," said one INFP. An ISFP commented that she becomes "very
aware that people at work are not following procedures and are making
the same mistakes over and over again. But when I think about it
later, I have to admit there are no more mistakes than usual."

<br/>
<br/>

An extreme, even passionate, focus on the evil and wrongdoing in the
world may also indicate Introverted Feeling types' hypersensitivity to
the "Thinking" issues of truth and justice. Their often-noted idealism
about the perfectibility of humanity may also reflect their discomfort
with the harsh reality of an imperfect world.This kind of all-or-none
approach is a reflection of the unconscious, black-and-white character
of their inferior function.

<br/>
<br/>

Because their opposites, Extraverted Thinking types, can be
experienced as intimidating, ISFPs and INFPs are sensitive to
perceived negative messages from these types. They may project their
own black-and-white critical judgments onto them, seeing ESTJs and
ENTJs as hypercritical, controlling, demanding, and
intrusive. Straightforward comments from an Extraverted Thinking type
may therefore be taken as global criticism and simple requests as
dictatorial commands.

<br/>
<br/>

People whose daily work requires them to use less-preferred functions
may use their preferred processes in their leisure time. An ISFP
business manager described suppressing her dominant Feeling and
auxiliary Sensing at work, where Thinking and Intuition are more
highly valued. She spends as much of her free time as possible
enjoying the outdoors.  This comes naturally to her and is the most
comfortable and relaxing place for her to be.There is a similar
tendency for Extraverted Feeling types to engage their preferred
functions in leisure activities.

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling types frequently mention that an atmosphere of
negativity and excessive criticism provides a fertile context for an
eruption of their inferior function. Even if the criticism is not
directed at them, it brings out their Extraverted Thinking in a
black-and-white form. They harshly attack the people who are being
negative and critical—for being negative and critical!

<br/>
<br/>

As an important part of her job, an INFP nursing supervisor critiqued
the records and charts of the nurses who worked under her. One nurse,
also an INFP, invariably became furious when his charts were reviewed.
He accused his supervisor of gross insensitivity and pettiness and of
being unfit for her job. Though the supervisor tried valiantly to view
these attacks in context, they would often "send her into a tailspin”
and she would be filled with self-doubt, guilt, and a sense of
incompetence about her performance. In the context of each having to
use less-preferred processes, these two INFPs constellated their own
and each other's inferior functions.

<br/>
<br/>

Fears of impending loss and separation from people who are impor- tant
to them can serve as triggers for ISFPs and INFPs. One INFP said he is
most likely to fall into the grip of his inferior function "when
something very dear to me is threatened and I'm afraid I'll lose my
most valued connections with life." An ISFP said that for her it is
"when my attachments to people are demeaned and invalidated."

<br/>
<br/>

Work environments that offer little opportunity for fulfillment of
Introverted Feeling values are inherently stressful for ISFPs and
INFPs, even if other stressors are absent. If such limited opportunity
is accompanied by conflict, difficult and controlling people, and a
bottom-line atmosphere oriented to deadlines and rigid rules and
procedures, the workplace can become intolerable for Introverted
Feeling types.An ISFP finds it stressful to "work with people who are
very focused on regulations and rules," and another said, "I dislike
strict deadlines and like to move at my own pace."  One INFP said she
was stressed by "office politics that are out of line with my personal
values, not being heard, and disregarded." Another INFP's stressors
included "dealing with details, making arrangements, applying policy
to a situation and balancing that with my personal values; having to
do paperwork that meets the mandate of my organization but not my
'personal mandate.'" The following description by an INFP includes
many Introverted Feeling stressors: "constant interruptions and
demands on my time; a hostile environment; dysfunctional
relationships; unappreciative managers and disgruntled, complaining
co-workers and clients."

<br/>
<br/>

In a work situation in which the particular stressors for Introverted
Feeling types persist over a long period, an ISFP or INFP may be
pushed into the grip very quickly and powerfully by the triggers
described here.  His or her subsequent demonstrations of "grip”
behavior are likely to be frequent and pervasive. When persistent
stress causes them to be chronically in the grip of inferior
Extraverted Thinking, Introverted Feeling types are likely to lose
touch with their inner values, believing them to be muddled and
untrustworthy. They may eventually begin to feel hopeless and
despairing about themselves and the human condition.

<br/>
<br/>

In the early stages of expression of their inferior function,
Introverted Feeling types often project their unconscious fears of
their own incompetence. They become hypersensitive to others'
mistakes. Because of the Extraverted attitude of their inferior
function, the projections often extend to large segments of the outer
world, encompassing much of humanity. Once caught up in this state,
they see incompetence in employees, bosses, colleagues, strangers on
the street, the person on the other end of the telephone, drivers on
the highway, local and national institutions, and major world figures.

<br/>
<br/>

When this projection of their sense of incompetence fails to take care
of whatever has triggered it, the negative energy of the inferior function
takes the form of critical self-judgment. Introverted Feeling types become
focused on their own incompetence, extending it both backward and for-
ward in time and including the world at large in their conclusion. In the
words of one INFP:

<br/>
<br/>

"I become overwhelmed by an awareness that I am totally incompetent
at everything I do, that I always have been and always will be - and that
the whole world knows it! The truth of this is beyond doubt. I am mor-
tified at not recognizing this before, and of compounding the offense by
acting as if I were competent. I am unable to verbalize my despair to
others for fear I will make a fool of myself by acknowledging my for-
mer ignorance of my true lack of ability. I view my advanced degrees
and other achievements as the result of people feeling sorry for me - 
I was too emotionally fragile to be told the truth."

<br/>
<br/>

"Everything seems impossible," said an ISFP. "I begin to lose faith in
my ability to do even the simplest task, and I especially distrust my
ability to make competent decisions about my life." An INFP said, "I
become rigid and think I am stupid, hopeless, etc. I often play a
mental videotape of all the times I remember getting things wrong."
Another INFP described being "very arbitrary, loud, direct,
hateful. I become inflexible, rigid, and most intolerant. I make snap
judgments and become quite self-condemning. I think it's all over;
I'm no longer worthwhile."

<br/>
<br/>

When feeling vulnerable, another INFP worried about whether his
teachers had paid sufficient attention to his work to properly
evaluate it.  "Maybe they were so wrapped up in their own work that I
slipped through undetected," he said. An ISFP said, "I review all the
mistakes I ever made in my life and then conclude that I am a bona
fide failure at everything I attempt to do, despite any evidence to
the contrary."

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

"I remember the first albatross I ever saw. ... At intervals, it arched forth
its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings
and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some
king's ghost in super natural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,
methought I peeped to secrets not below the heavens. As Abraham before the
angels, I bowed myself..." --(Herman Melville, Moby Dick)

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs never seem to lose their sense of wonder. One might say they see life
through rose-colored glasses. It's as though they live at the edge of a
looking-glass world where mundane objects come to life, where flora and fauna
take on near-human qualities.

<br/>
<br/>

INFP children often exhibit this in a 'Calvin and Hobbes' fashion, switching
from reality to fantasy and back again. With few exceptions, it is the NF child
who readily develops imaginary playmates (as with Anne of Green Gables's
"bookcase girlfriend"--her own reflection) and whose stuffed animals come to
life like the Velveteen Rabbit and the Skin Horse:

<br/>
<br/>

"...Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off,
and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But
these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly,
except to people who don't understand..." (the Skin Horse)

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs have the ability to see good in almost anyone or anything. Even for the
most unlovable the INFP is wont to have pity.

<br/>
<br/>

Rest you, my enemy,
<br/>
Slain without fault,
<br/>
Life smacks but tastelessly
<br/>
Lacking your salt!
<br/>
Stuck in a bog whence naught
<br/>
May catapult me,
<br/>
Come from the grave, long-sought,
<br/>
Come and insult me!
<br/>
--(Steven Vincent Benet, Elegy for an Enemy) 

<br/>
<br/>

Their extreme depth of feeling is often hidden, even from themselves, until circumstances evoke an impassioned response:

<br/>
<br/>

"I say, Queequeg! Why don't you speak? It's I--Ishmael." But all remained still
as before. ... Something must have happened. Apoplexy!  ... And running up after
me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door. ... "Have to
burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a good
start, when the landlady caught me, again vowing I should not break down her
premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full
against the mark.--(Melville, Moby Dick)

<br/>
<br/>

Of course, not all of life is rosy, and INFPs are not exempt from the same
disappointments and frustrations common to humanity. As INTPs tend to have a
sense of failed competence, INFPs struggle with the issue of their own ethical
perfection, e.g., perfo rmance of duty for the greater cause. An INFP friend
describes the inner conflict as not good versus bad, but on a grand scale, Good
vs. Evil. Luke Skywalker in Star Wars depicts this conflict in his struggle
between the two sides of "The Force." Although the dark side must be reckoned
with, the INFP believes that good ultimately triumphs.

<br/>
<br/>

Some INFPs have a gift for taking technical information and putting it into
layman's terms. Brendan Kehoe's Zen and the Art of the Internet is one example
of this "de-jargoning" talent in action.

<br/>
<br/>

Functional Analysis: 

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Feeling INFPs live primarily in a rich inner
world of introverted Feeling. Being inward-turning, the natural attraction is
away from world and toward essence and ideal. This introversion of dominant
Feeling, receiving its data from extraverted intuition, must be the source of
the quixotic nature of these usually gentle beings. Feeling is caught in the
approach- avoidance bind between concern both for people and for All Creatures
Great and Small, and a psycho-magnetic repulsion from the same. The "object," be
it homo sapiens or a mere representation of an organism, is valued only to the
degree that the object contains some measure of the inner Essence or greater
Good. Doing a good deed, for example, may provide intrinsic satisfaction which
is only secondary to the greater good of striking a blow against Man's
Inhumanity to Mankind.  

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted iNtuition 

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted intuition faces outward, greeting the world on behalf of
Feeling. What the observer usually sees is creativity with implied good
will. Intuition spawns this type's philosophical bent and strengthens pattern
perception. It combines as auxiliary with introverted Feeling and gives rise to
unusual skill in both character development and fluency with language--a sound
basis for the development of literary facility. If INTPs aspire to word
mechanics, INFPs would be verbal artists.  

<br/>
<br/>

Introverted Sensing 

<br/>
<br/>

Sensing is introverted and often invisible. This stealth function in the third
position gives INFPs a natural inclination toward absent- mindedness and
other-worldliness, however, Feeling's strong people awareness provides a
balancing, mitigating effect. This introverted Sensing is somewhat categorical,
a subdued version of SJ sensing. In the third position, however, it is easily
overridden by the stronger functions.  

<br/>
<br/>

Extraverted Thinking 

<br/>
<br/>

The INFP may turn to inferior extraverted Thinking for help in focusing on
externals and for closure. INFPs can even masquerade in their ESTJ business
suit, but not without expending considerable energy. The inferior, problematic
nature of Extraverted Thinking is its lack of context and proportion. Single
impersonal facts may loom large or attain higher priority than more salient
principles which are all but overlooked.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

The Idealist

<br/>
<br/>

As an INFP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal
with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your
personal value system. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in
primarily via your intuition.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs, more than other iNtuitive Feeling types, are focused on making the world
a better place for people. Their primary goal is to find out their meaning in
life. What is their purpose? How can they best serve humanity in their lives?
They are idealists and perfectionists, who drive themselves hard in their quest
for achieving the goals they have identified for themselves

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are highly intuitive about people. They rely heavily on their intuitions
to guide them, and use their discoveries to constantly search for value in
life. They are on a continuous mission to find the truth and meaning underlying
things. Every encounter and every piece of knowledge gained gets sifted through
the INFP's value system, and is evaluated to see if it has any potential to help
the INFP define or refine their own path in life. The goal at the end of the
path is always the same - the INFP is driven to help people and make the world a
better place.

<br/>
<br/>

Generally thoughtful and considerate, INFPs are good listeners and put people at
ease. Although they may be reserved in expressing emotion, they have a very deep
well of caring and are genuinely interested in understanding people. This
sincerity is sensed by others, making the INFP a valued friend and
confidante. An INFP can be quite warm with people he or she knows well.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs do not like conflict, and go to great lengths to avoid it. If they must
face it, they will always approach it from the perspective of their feelings. In
conflict situations, INFPs place little importance on who is right and who is
wrong. They focus on the way that the conflict makes them feel, and indeed don't
really care whether or not they're right. They don't want to feel badly. This
trait sometimes makes them appear irrational and illogical in conflict
situations. On the other hand, INFPs make very good mediators, and are typically
good at solving other people's conflicts, because they intuitively understand
people's perspectives and feelings, and genuinely want to help them.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are flexible and laid-back, until one of their values is violated. In the
face of their value system being threatened, INFPs can become aggressive
defenders, fighting passionately for their cause. When an INFP has adopted a
project or job which they're interested in, it usually becomes a "cause" for
them. Although they are not detail-oriented individuals, they will cover every
possible detail with determination and vigor when working for their "cause".

<br/>
<br/>

When it comes to the mundane details of life maintenance, INFPs are typically
completely unaware of such things. They might go for long periods without
noticing a stain on the carpet, but carefully and meticulously brush a speck of
dust off of their project booklet.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs do not like to deal with hard facts and logic. Their focus on their
feelings and the Human Condition makes it difficult for them to deal with
impersonal judgment. They don't understand or believe in the validity of
impersonal judgment, which makes them naturally rather ineffective at using
it. Most INFPs will avoid impersonal analysis, although some have developed this
ability and are able to be quite logical. Under stress, it's not uncommon for
INFPs to mis-use hard logic in the heat of anger, throwing out fact after (often
inaccurate) fact in an emotional outburst.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs have very high standards and are perfectionists. Consequently, they are
usually hard on themselves, and don't give themselves enough credit. INFPs may
have problems working on a project in a group, because their standards are
likely to be higher than other members' of the group. In group situations, they
may have a "control" problem. The INFP needs to work on balancing their high
ideals with the requirements of every day living. Without resolving this
conflict, they will never be happy with themselves, and they may become confused
and paralyzed about what to do with their lives.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are usually talented writers. They may be awkard and uncomfortable with
expressing themselves verbally, but have a wonderful ability to define and
express what they're feeling on paper. INFPs also appear frequently in social
service professions, such as counselling or teaching. They are at their best in
situations where they're working towards the public good, and in which they
don't need to use hard logic.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs who function in their well-developed sides can accomplish great and
wonderful things, which they will rarely give themselves credit for. Some of the
great, humanistic catalysts in the world have been INFPs.

<br/>
<br/>

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/>
<br/>
Dominant: Introverted Feeling
<br/>
Auxiliary: Extraverted Intuition
<br/>
Tertiary: Introverted Sensing
<br/>
Inferior: Extraverted Thinking

<br/>
<br/>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFP

<br/>
<br/>

Keirsey referred to the INFPs as Healers, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Idealists. INFPs are one of the rarest types,
accounting for about 1-5% of the population.

<br/>
<br/>

According to Myers-Briggs, INFPs focus much of their energy on an inner
world dominated by intense feeling and deeply held ethics. They seek an external
life that is in keeping with these values. Loyal to the people and causes
important to them, INFPs can quickly spot opportunities to implement their
ideals. They are curious to understand those around them, and so are accepting
and flexible except when their values are threatened.

<br/>
<br/>

The polite, reserved exterior of INFPs can at first make them difficult to get
to know. They enjoy conversation, however, taking particular delight in the
unusual. When INFPs are in a sociable mood, their humor and charm shine
through. Disposed to like people and to avoid conflict, INFPs tend to make
pleasant company. 

<br/>
<br/>

Devoted to those in their inner circle, INFPs guard the emotional well-being of
others, consoling those in distress. Guided by their desire for harmony, INFPs
prefer to be flexible unless their ethics are violated. Then, they become
passionate advocates for their beliefs. They are often able to sway the opinions
of others through tact, diplomacy, and an ability to see varying sides of an
issue. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs develop these insights through reflection, and they require substantial
time alone to ponder and process new information. While they can be quite
patient with complex material, they are generally bored by routine. Though not
always organized, INFPs are meticulous about things they value. Perfectionists,
they may have trouble completing a task because it cannot meet their high
standards. They may even go back to a completed project after the deadline so
they can improve it. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are creative types and often have a gift for language. As introverts, they
may prefer to express themselves through writing. Their dominant Feeling drives
their desire to communicate, while their auxiliary intuition supplies the
imagination. Having a talent for symbolism, they enjoy metaphors and
similes. They continually seek new ideas and adapt well to change. They prefer
working in an environment that values these gifts and allows them to make a
positive difference in the world, according to their personal beliefs.

<br/>
<br/>

Cognitive functions

<br/>
<br/>

Jung and Myers considered the attitude of the Auxiliary, Tertiary, and Inferior
functions to be the opposite of the Dominant. In this interpretation, if the
Dominant function is extraverted, then the other three are introverted, and vice
versa. However, many modern practitioners hold that the attitude of the Tertiary
function is the same as the Dominant. Using the more modern interpretation,
the cognitive functions of the INFP are as follows: Dominant: Introverted
feeling (Fi)

<br/>
<br/>

Ne finds and interprets hidden meanings, using "what if" questions to
explore alternatives, allowing multiple possibilities to coexist. This
imaginative play weaves together insights and experiences from various sources
to form a new whole, which can then become a catalyst to action. INFPs
engage the outside world primarily with intuition. They are adept at seeing the
big picture, sensing patterns and the flow of existence from the past toward the
future.Tertiary: Introverted sensing (Si)

<br/>
<br/>

Si collects data in the present moment and compares it with past experiences, a
process that sometimes evokes the feelings associated with memory, as if the
subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect what is familiar, Si draws upon
history to form goals and expectations about what will happen in the future.
This function gives INFPs a natural inclination toward "other-worldliness" and
makes them more easily distracted.

<br/>
<br/>

Inferior: Extraverted thinking (Te)

Te organizes and schedules ideas and the environment to ensure the efficient,
productive pursuit of objectives. Te seeks logical explanations for actions,
events, and conclusions, looking for faulty reasoning and lapses in
sequence. This function helps INFPs focus on external details, but being the
inferior function, requires the expenditure of greater energy and is not as
reliable.

<br/>
<br/>

http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/myers-briggs/infp.htm

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs direct their energy towards the inner world of thoughts and emotions. They give importance to particular ideas or beliefs, focusing on those things that they belief in most strongly. They prefer dealing with patterns and possibilities, especially for people. They prefer to undertake work that has a meaningful purpose.

<br/>
<br/>

What makes an INFP tick?

<br/>
<br/>

The Dominant function is the judging one of Feeling. Characteristics associated
with this function include:

<br/>
<br/>

* Makes decisions on the basis of personal values
<br/>
* Is appreciative and accepting of people - enjoying company and seeking harmony
<br/>
* Assesses the impact of decisions on others, being sympathetic or compassionate
<br/>
* Takes a personal approach 

<br/>
<br/>

The judging Feeling function is introverted. That is, Feeling is used primarily
to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The INFP will therefore: 

<br/>
<br/>

* develop an inner emotional life that is often unseen to others, but is
experienced as intense 
<br/>
* retain a strong sense of values, which are often not expressed 
<br/>
* emotionally accept or reject various aspects of life - for example, deciding
whether praise or criticism received is valid and, at extreme, ignoring whatever
is unacceptable 
<br/>
* feel appreciation towards others, but not express it  

<br/>
<br/>

The Feeling function is primarily supported by extraverted iNtuitive perception,
That is, iNtuitive perception is used primarily to manage the outer world of
actions and spoken words. This will modify the way that the Feeling is directed,
by: 

<br/>
<br/>

* focusing the (inner world) Feeling on ideas and possibilities for people
<br/>
* looking for meaningful relationships
<br/>
* deciding on friendships through insight into their personality and motivation  

<br/>
<br/>

The classic temperament of an INFP is Apollonian, or Choleric, for whom a basic
driving force is the search for meaning or purpose. 

<br/>
<br/>

Contributions to the team of an INFP

<br/>
<br/>

In a team environment, the INFP can contribute by:

<br/>
<br/>

* promoting insight and common understanding amongst the team
<br/>
* contributing well thought out and innovative ideas
<br/>
* generating team spirit though sensitive listening and a quiet enthusiasm
<br/>
* focusing on areas of agreement and building on others' proposals
<br/>
* where there are areas of disagreement, exploring a wide range of options to
<br/>
see if a point of agreement can be found  

<br/>
<br/>

The potential ways in which an INFP can irritate others include:

<br/>
<br/>

* being idealistic
<br/>
* appearing out of touch, perhaps not fully recognising current realities, and
<br/>
disregarding those they find unacceptable 
<br/>
* being stubborn over issues the group did not anticipate being a problem
<br/>
* spending too much time thinking
<br/>
* avoiding conflict and not giving forthright criticism when it is needed 
<br/>
* focusing so much on interpersonal issues that cost and other impersonal
considerations are not adequately discussed  

<br/>
<br/>

Personal Growth

<br/>
<br/>

As with all types, the INFP can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as:

<br/>
<br/>

* being prepared to declare the INFP's personal values
<br/>
* investigating and recognising the facts before interpreting what they mean 
<br/>
* listing options and undertaking a formal process of evaluation against
criteria, including a cost benefit analysis 
<br/>
* undertaking a critical appraisal of a situation or person, and expressing
disagreement or criticism when it could be of value to the recipient 
<br/>
* focusing on impersonal details during discussions and when making decisions 
<br/>
* listing options and undertaking a formal process of evaluation against
criteria, including a cost benefit analysis 
<br/>
* establishing a long term goal, preparing a detailed implementation plan, and
sticking to it  

<br/>
<br/>

Recognising Stress

<br/>
<br/>

As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style,
so the INFP will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For
example, in a crisis, the INFP might: 

<br/>
<br/>

* concentrate only on what the INFP sees as important
<br/>
* work alone if possible
<br/>
* contribute creative ideas, but overlook current realities
<br/>
* fail to consider the cost implications 

<br/>
<br/>

Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the INFP's shadow may appear - a
negative form of ESTJ. Example characteristics are: 

<br/>
<br/>

* being very critical and find fault with almost everything
<br/>
* doing things to excess - e.g.: eating, drinking or exercising
<br/>
* becoming bossy or domineering and ignoring others' feelings
<br/>
* being pedantic about unimportant details 

<br/>
<br/>

The shadow is part of the unconscious that is often visible to others, onto whom
the shadow is projected. The INFP may therefore readily see these faults in
others without recognising it in him/her self.


<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

The INFP often lets others get the best of them. The INFP doesn’t
believe in ‘rocking the boat’ and that can frustrate friends who wait
for the INFP to take action. There is almost nothing the INFP will do
in order to avoid conflict.

<br/>
<br/>

In a love relationship the INFP feels more than they express. This is
a double-edged sword because they never fully explain what bothers
them and therefore never really solve a problem. They live by a code
that calls for harmony but are often caught in between the desired
harmony and the inability to express their frustrations.

<br/>
<br/>

If the family is jovial and getting along the INFP is extremely happy
but the second things get unpleasant the INFP is out the door.

<br/>
<br/>

INFP Personality Type in Careers

<br/>
<br/>

The INFP wants to help their fellow man. The field of teaching is full
of INFP's as is church service groups and the medical profession. This
is not to say the INFP isn't interested in money, they will strive to
get a healthy balance of both.  Hard work is nothing new to the INFP
and they almost crave it. Other popular INFP career directions
include: Designer, College Professor, Researcher and Human Resources.

<br/>
<br/>

The INFP will ask, "who am I?" and want a real answer. They work hard
and school is a simple operation of applying the hard work, but the
question of self is their ultimate question and drives their
educational desires.


<br/>
<br/>

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INFP_rel.html

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs feel tremendous loyalty and commitment to their
relationships. With the Feeling preference dominating their
personality, harmony and warm feelings are central to the INFP's
being. They feel a need to be in a committed, loving relationship. If
they are not involved in such a relationship, the INFP will be either
actively searching for one, or creating one in their own minds.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs' tendency to be idealistic and romantically-minded may cause
them to fantasize frequently about a "more perfect" relationship or
situation. They may also romanticize their mates into having qualities
which they do not actually possess. Most INFPs have a problem with
reconciling their highly idealistic and romantic views of life with
the reality of their own lives, and so they are constantly somewhat
unsettled with themselves and with their close personal
relationships. However, the INFP's deeply-felt, sincere love for their
mates and their intense dislike of conflict keeps the INFP loyal to
their relationships, in spite of their troubles achieving peace of
mind.
        
<br/>
<br/>

Unlike other types who tend to hold their mates up on a pedastal, the
INFP's tendency to do so does not really turn into a negative thing in
the relationship. INFPs hold tightly to their ideals, and work hard at
constantly seeing their mates up on that pedastal. The frequent INFP
result is a strongly affirming, proud and affectionate attitude
towards their mates which stands the test of time.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are not naturally interested in administrative matters such as
bill-paying and house-cleaning, but they can be very good at
performing these tasks when they must. They can be really good money
managers when they apply themselves.

<br/>
<br/>

Sexually, the INFP is likely to be initially slow to open up to their
mates. Once their trust has been earned, the INFP will view sexual
intimacy as an opportunity for expressing their deep-seated love and
affection. More than the actual sexual act, they will value giving and
receiving love and sweet words. With their tendency to enjoy serving
others, they may value their mates satisfaction above their own.

<br/>
<br/>

One real problem area for the INFP is their intensive dislike of
conflict and criticism. The INFP is quick to find a personal angle in
any critical comment, whether or not anything personal was
intended. They will tend to take any sort of criticism as a personal
attack on their character, and will usually become irrational and
emotional in such situations. This can be a real problem for INFPs who
are involved with persons who have Thinking and Judging
preferences. "TJ"s relate to others with a objective, decisive
attitude that frequently shows an opinion on the topic of
conversation. If the opinion is negative, the TJ's attitude may be
threatening to the INFP, who will tend to respond emotionally to the
negativity and be vaguely but emphatically convinced that the
negativity is somehow the INFP's fault.

<br/>
<br/>

For INFPs with extremely dominant Feeling preferences who have not
developed their Intuitive sides sufficiently to gather good data for
their decision making processes, their dislike of conflict and
criticism can foretell doom and gloom for intimate
relationships. These INFPs will react with extreme emotional distress
to conflict situations, and will not know what to do about it. Since
they will have no basis for determining what action to take, they will
do whatever they can to get rid of the conflict - which frequently
means lashing out irrationally at others, or using guilt manipulation
to get their mates to give them the positive support that they
crave. This kind of behavior does not bode well for healthy, long-term
relationships. Individuals who recognize this tendency in themselves
should work on their ability to take criticism objectively rather than
personally. They should also try to remember that conflict situations
are not always their fault, and they're definitely not the end of the
world. Conflict is a fact of life, and facing it and addressing it
immediately avoids having to deal with it in the future, after it has
become a much larger problem.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are very aware of their own space, and the space of others. They
value their personal space, and the freedom to do their own
thing. They will cherish the mate who sees the INFP for who they are,
and respects their unique style and perspectives. The INFP is not
likely to be overly jealous or possessive, and is likely to respect
their mate's privacy and independence. In fact, the INFP is likely to
not only respect their mate's perspectives and goals, but to support
them with loyal firmness.

<br/>
<br/>

In general, INFPs are warmly affirming and loving partners who make
the health of their relationships central in their lives. Although
cautious in the beginning, they become firmly loyal to their committed
relationships, which are likely to last a lifetime. They take their
relationships very seriously, and will put forth a great deal of
effort into making them work.

<br/>
<br/>

Although two well-developed individuals of any type can enjoy a
healthy relationship, INFP's natural partner is the ENFJ, or the
ESFJ. INFP's dominant function of Introverted Feeling is best matched
with a partner whose dominant function is Extraverted Feeling. The
INFP/ENFJ combination is ideal, because it shares the Intuiting way of
perceiving, but the INFP/ESFJ combination is also a good match. How
did we arrive at this?

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs present a calm, pleasant face to the world. They appear to be tranquil and
peaceful to others, with simple desires. In fact, the INFP internally feels his
or her life intensely. In the relationship arena, this causes them to have a
very deep capacity for love and caring which is not frequently found with such
intensity in the other types. The INFP does not devote their intense feelings
towards just anyone, and are relatively reserved about expressing their
inner-most feelings. They reserve their deepest love and caring for a select few
who are closest to them. INFPs are generally laid-back, supportive and nurturing
in their close relationships. With Introverted Feeling dominating their
personality, they're very sensitive and in-tune with people's feelings, and feel
genuine concern and caring for others. Slow to trust others and cautious in the
beginning of a relationship, an INFP will be fiercely loyal once they are
committed. With their strong inner core of values, they are intense individuals
who value depth and authenticity in their relationships, and hold those who
understand and accept the INFP's perspectives in especially high regard. INFPs
are usually adaptable and congenial, unless one of their ruling principles has
been violated, in which case they stop adapting and become staunch defenders of
their values. They will be uncharacteristically harsh and rigid in such a
situation.

<br/>
<br/>

http://www.insightsforchange.co.uk/Hirsh-Kummerow/INFP%20-%20The%20Dreamer.htm


<br/>
<br/>

INFPs focus deeply on their values, and they devote their lives to pursuing the
ideal. They often draw people together around a common purpose and work to find
a place for each person within the group. They are creative, and they seek new
ideas and possibilities. They quietly push for what is important to them, and
they rarely give up. While they have a gentleness about them and a delightful
sense of humor, they may be somewhat difficult to get to know and may be
overlooked by others. They are at their best making their world more in line
with their internal vision of perfection.

<br/>
<br/>

Living

<br/>
<br/>

INFP children often create their own fantasy world and live very much within
it. They may daydream about what is important to them, and sometimes others
wonder if they are in touch with reality. They often get lost in their thoughts
and books, and may develop a special ability in communicating, such as
writing. They are somewhat reserved, especially in new situations.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs decide early on what is important for them, what is of value. They tend to
rely on themselves for direction and are reticent to ask others for help. They
would rather do things themselves, to make sure they are done properly. INFPs
have found this to be both a strength and a curse. Depending only on themselves
and being careful not to show mistakes to others is important. As teens, INFPs
may have a bit of a rebellious streak. They may argue with those who hold
different values than they do. They are also likely to have a small, close set
of friends with whom they share good times. In the comfort of those close
relationships, they can relax and are often quite entertaining, since they see
the world in a different and special way. Their sense of humour is readily
apparent. However, unless an INFP finds an appreciation for his or her
uniqueness and personal values, he or she may feel like an odd person out.

<br/>
<br/>

When they set their minds on things, INFPs are not likely to give up easily, yet
because of their outward gentleness, they do not show their determination. They
may not take a direct path, but somehow they reach their dreams.

<br/>
<br/>

As young adults, INFPs may have some difficulty finding the ideal career and the
ideal mate, in part because of that very word 'ideal'. They have a vision in
mind of what they want, yet reality may not follow suit. They may make several
starts and stops in their career until they find a comfortable place for
themselves.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs have a need for perfection in connection with their personal values. They
become frustrated with those who dwell on trivialities.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs need a purpose beyond the paycheck. They become burned out easily if their
job does not fit their value system; they may not feel good enough about what
they have achieved and, as a result, may undervalue themselves and their
contributions.

<br/>
<br/>

In retirement, INFPs need to look back and feel that they have led a worthwhile
life that has made a difference. They want time for a variety of activities,
including travel. They may also be very attached to their family and enjoy
special visits with them.

<br/>
<br/>

Learning

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs learn best in flexible situations where they know the teacher takes a
personal interest in them. They like to be able to interact with their peers,
but not too much so. They want to feel free to dig into subjects that are of
interest to them. Having both flexibility and creativity rewarded is encouraging
to them. While they may not enjoy deadlines, if they value the assignment, they
will meet those deadlines. Deadlines may force INFPs to decide that their work
is 'good enough' to turn in.

<br/>
<br/>

Subjects that hold a great deal of interest for them are learned readily. They
will often do extra work in their attempt to learn as much as possible about
something of interest. And they often read assignments carefully and them work
their creativity into the given framework of the assignment. Thus it may appear
that they did not pay careful attention to the details of the assignment in
their reinterpretation. It is best if they have teachers who appreciate their
unique approach and who do not hold them to the letter of the law.

<br/>
<br/>

Working

<br/>
<br/>

At work, INFPs contribute their creativity, their value system, and their
ability to work with others. They are able to see the larger picture and how
specific programs fit in. They do not dwell on the trivialities or the
details. Their job must be fun, although not racous, and it must be meaningful
to them. They need a strong purpose in their work. They want to be recognized
and valued, without undue attention given to them. They may become embarrassed
when make the center of attention. As a result, they may undersell their
strengths in order to avoid being singled out and made to feel conspicuous. They
would rather have their worth be noticed gradually over time.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs like to work with cooperative people committed to the same values that
they are. They can become bothered when they see others working at cross
purposes, especially when conflict is overt. They do not like competition or
bureaucracy. They need privacy. Calm and quiet appeal to them, as does time and
space for reflection. People usually like working with INFPs even though they
may not know them well.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are quite disorganized. But when tasks at hand are important and best done
in an organized way, INFPs strive to do so. Practicality is not a driving force
for INFPs. Things that traditionally belong together may not be placed together
because the INFP does not see it as necessary. They have trouble finishing what
they start because of their perfectionistic nature. When they do finish a
project, they may not consider it done 'for good.' Projects can always be
improved upon, revised, and reworked, and therefore INFPs find it hard to bring
tasks to closure. Because they are able to visualize the finished product long
before it is done, the actual completion is of less importance.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs prefer occupations in which they can be involved in making the world
better. Having their heart in their work is important to them. These occupations
also allow for an element of creativity and flexibility. INFPs are particularly
interested to be counselor, editor, education consultant, English teacher, fine
arts teacher, journalist, psychologist, religious educator, social scientist,
social worker, teacher, writer, and other occupations that engage their values.

<br/>
<br/>

Leading

<br/>
<br/>

The INFP leadership style is subtle, gentle, indirect, and inclusive of
others. INFPs do not confront people head-on, but rather work with them and
through them to get the job done. Their style is not an aggressive one but is
highly persistent; only reluctantly do INFPs assume leadership roles.

<br/>
<br/>

They lead with their values in mind, and these guide them. They prefer not to
take a hands-on approach with others but to allow them to achieve in independent
ways. They are facilitative rather than directive. They encourage others by
appreciation and praise. Critiquing others does not come easily to them.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs seldom confront situations directly, in part because they do not like
conflict. Whenever possible, they would rather wait for a situation to work
itself out, since they trust that people will work things through. They do not
like following all the rules and regulations, but they are not overtly
rebellious. They seek to get things done in their own style.

<br/>
<br/>

Leisure

<br/>
<br/>

Leisure activities are very important to INFPs, but at times it is difficult for
them to separate work from play. When a new leisure pursuit is found, INFPs
typically do a great deal of research. They may read many books and make several
phone calls to dig for information.

<br/>
<br/>

Many of the INFPs' leisure activities are done alone --- reading, listening to
music, and gardening are some activities likely to appeal to them. Reflection
time and the opportunity to make sure things are right are important. INFPs
often enjoy leisure pursuits with loved ones as well. When they want to be
sociable, they can be exceedingly charming and outgoing. Their flexibility,
gentleness, and sense of humour can make them quite popular in social
situations.

<br/>
<br/>

Loving

<br/>
<br/>

For the INFP, love is a very deep commitment, and one that is not easily
attained. They have ideals, and therefore reality may be carefully scrutinized.

<br/>
<br/>

With their ideal firmly envisioned, the first date with that special person is
carefully planned and prepared for, and often every aesthetic thing is taken
care of. The flowers are in place, the right wine is ordered, and the proper
meal is prepared.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs may have difficulty sharing their feelings about others. They keep so many
of those feelings inside that they may forget to tell their partner how much
they love and appreciate them. They also need reminders of their partner's love.

<br/>
<br/>

When things go wrong in a relationship, the INFP takes it to heart but does not
readily discuss it with others. They may not be willing to communicate to let
others know how they are feeling. When scorned, they are very hurt and may
overreact in an almost maudlin way.

<br/>
<br/>

Profile by David Keirsey

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs present a calm, pleasant face to the world and are seen as reticent and
even shy. Although they demonstrate a cool reserve toward others, inside they
are anything but distant. They have a capacity for caring which is not always
found in other types. They care deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special
persons or a cause. One word that captures this type is idealistic. At times,
this characteristic leaves them feeling isolated, especially since INFPs are
found in only 1 percent of the general population. INFPs have a profound sense
of honor derived from internal values. The INFP is the Prince or Princess of
mythology, the King's Champion, Defender of the Faith, and guardian of the
castle. Sir Galahad and Joan of Arc are male and female prototypes of an
INFP. To understand INFPs their cause must be understood, for they are willing
to make unusual sacrifices for someone or something believed in.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs seek unity in their lives, unity of body and mind, emotions and
intellect. They often have a subtle tragic motif running through their lives,
but others seldom detect this inner minor key. The deep commitment of INFPs to
the positive and the good causes them to be alert to the negative and the evil,
which can take the form of a fascination with the profane. Thus INFPs may live a
paradox, drawn toward purity and unity but looking over the shoulder toward the
sullied and desecrated. When INFPs believe that they have yielded to an impure
temptation, they may be given to acts of self-sacrifice in atonement. The
atonement, however, is within the INFP, who does not feel compelled to make
public the issue.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs prefer the valuing process over the purely logical. They respond to the
beautiful versus the ugly, the good versus the bad, and the moral versus the
immoral. Impressions are gained in a fluid, global, diffused way. Metaphors and
similes come naturally but may be strained. INFPs have a gift for interpreting
symbols, as well as creating them, and thus often write in lyric fashion. They
may demonstrate a tendency to take deliberate liberties with logic. Unlike the
NT, they see logic as something optional. INFPs also may, at times, assume an
unwarranted familiarity with a domain, because their global, impressionistic way
of dealing with reality may have failed to register a sufficient number of
details for mastery. INFPs may have difficulty thinking in terms of a
conditional framework; they see things as either real or fancied, and are
impatient with the hypothetical.

<br/>
<br/>

Career

<br/>
<br/>

At work, INFPs are adaptable, welcome new ideas and new information, are well
aware of people and their feelings, and relate well to most, albeit with some
psychological distance. INFPs dislike telephone interruptions and work well
alone, as well as with others. They are patient with complicated situations, but
impatient with routine details. They can make errors of fact, but seldom of
values. Their career choices may be toward the ministry, missionary work,
college teaching, psychiatry, architecture, psychology-and away from
business. They seem willing and usually are able to apply themselves
scholastically to gain the necessary training for professional work, often doing
better in college than in high school. They have a natural interest in scholarly
activities and demonstrate, as do the other NF's, a remarkable facility for
languages. Often they hear a calling to go forth into the world to help others;
they seem willing to make the necessary personal sacrifices involved in
responding to that call, even if it means asking others to do likewise. INFPs
can make outstanding novelists and character actors, for they are able to efface
their own personalities in their portrayal of a character in a way other types
cannot.

<br/>
<br/>

Home

<br/>
<br/>

As mates, INFPs have a deep commitment to their pledges. They like to live in
harmony and may go to great lengths to avoid constant conflict. They are
sensitive to the feelings of others and enjoy pleasing those they care for. They
may find it difficult to reconcile a romantic, idealized concept of conjugal
life with the realities of everyday living with another person. At times, in
fact, INFPs may seem fearful of exuberant attainment, afraid that current
advances may have to be paid for with later sacrifices. The devil is sure to get
his due if the INFP experiences too freely of success, or beauty, or health, or
wealth, or knowledge. And thus, INFPs guard against giving way to relaxing in
the happiness of mating. They may have difficulty in expressing affection
directly, but communicate interest and affection indirectly.

<br/>
<br/>

For INFPs, their home is their castle. As parents, they are fierce in protection
of home and family and are devoted to the welfare of family members. They have a
strong capacity for devotion, sympathy, and adaptability in their relationships,
and thus are easy to live with. They are loyal to their family and, although
they may dream of greener pastures, if they stray into those pastures they soon
locate the nettles. The almost preconscious conviction that pleasure must be
paid for with pain can cause a sense of uneasiness in the family system of an
INFP, who may transmit an air of being ever-vigilant against invasion. In the
routine rituals of daily living, INFPs tend to be compliant and may even prefer
having decisions made on their behalf, until their value system is violated!
Then INFPs dig in their heels and will not budge from ideals. Life with an INFP
will go gently along for long periods, until an ideal is struck and
violated. Then an INFP will resist and insist.

<br/>
<br/>

Midlife

<br/>
<br/>

At midlife INFPs may want to increase mastery of intellectual interests, perhaps
taking advanced degrees in a chosen profession. They also may want to explore
the sensual side of their natures, expanding their aesthetic appreciations to
include physical sensory appreciations. Extending social activities and contacts
may offer new horizons for INFPs, but they will have to guard against
overextension psychologically, for before, during, and after midlife the
vulnerability and sensitivity of the INFP will continue, and he or she can
easily become emotionally drained.

<br/>
<br/>

Mates

<br/>
<br/>

The INFP questor probably has more problems in mating than any other type. Let
us be mindful of the relative infrequency: about 1 1/4 percent, say two and a
half million people in the USA. Their problem lies in their primary outlook on
life. "Life," says the INFP, "is a very serious matter." Now when a person makes
his life a kind of crusade or a series of crusades, then there's bound to be
some taxing of the spouse. If the INFP takes the other tack, the "monastic" (and
the same person can tack back and forth - now a crusader, now a monastic), the
spouse will find himself again taxed, trying to draw the monastic out of his
dark meditative cave.

<br/>
<br/>

The opposites of our crusading monastic seem well equipped for this
alternating-phase taxation: ENTJ and ESTJ. Both are anchored in the real world
with a vengeance. The ENTJ marshaling his or her forces toward distant
objectives, the ESTJ administrating in a solid, dependable, and traditional way
whatever is his or hers to administer. Both provide anchorage to a person who
might otherwise get lost in meditation or in crusade. Selection of a mate of
irrelevant form (e.g., an ISTP artisan or an ESTP promoter) would not be the
wisest of tactics in so serious a business as life.

<br/>
<br/>

http://www.centreforconfidence.co.uk/type-resources.php?pid=375

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are insightful and extremely perceptive types who care very
passionately about their duties and the things they believe in. As
introverts they can be somewhat reserved and so their warmth and
idealism are not usually evident until you get to know them better.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs prefer to engage with the outer world through their intuitive
process. This means they come across primarily as "ideas people". In a
quiet and sometimes low-key way INFPs will engage others in
discussions about their ideas and projects. Abstract theories attract
them greatly and so they will confidently discuss theories and
observations on life and all its mysteries.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs often make congenial company. They can have a wry and
individualistic sense of humour. They do not have a great need to talk
much in social groups or with talkative individuals.  With no strong
urge to express him/herself, an INFP will gladly give others the floor
and act as listener or observers.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs may prefer to use their intuition in the outer world but they
are feelers at heart. The combination of feeling with intuition means
most INFPs are sensitive individuals who are acutely aware of "the
human condition". INFPs are more likely to express this sensitivity in
writing than in speech and many of our novelists, poets, playwrights
and journalists have a preference for INFP.

<br/>
<br/>

The types who extravert their feelings (ENFJ and ESFJ) are interested
in meeting others’ needs and in living in harmony with them. INFPs,
however, as introverted feelers are much more concerned about living
in harmony with their own feelings. In effect, this means they have a
pressing need to live their lives in accordance with their values. In
other words, they have a strong need to be authentic individuals who
are true to themselves.

<br/>
<br/>

This approach to life leads many INFPs into jobs where it is easy for
them to have a sense of mission or purpose. This may be teaching, the
clergy or counselling. Many become academics. But it is not uncommon
for INFPs to enter careers where it’s hard for them to feel they are
living in congruence with their values. Then INFPs can feel
dissatisfied -both because they can’t see the social benefit of what
they are doing and because it doesn’t feel right for them as
individuals. When this happens it is easy for the INFP to feel acutely
alienated and unfulfilled. If this feeling persists INFPs can become
cynical.

<br/>
<br/>

It can be difficult to really get to know INFPs. Of all the types they
can be very "deep" and they often claim that other people don’t really
understand what makes them tick. Yet relationships are incredibly
important to INFPs and they usually need to feel connected to others
in some way. They can be very good at reading between the lines and
picking up on how others are feeling. They are good listeners and they
will sensitively help others talk about problems and come up with
solutions which are right for that person. INFPs regularly say they
particularly enjoy helping people to feel good about
themselves. Others value INFPs’ sensitivity and it is often to an INFP
that people will turn for support in their darkest hour. INFPs can,
however, be critical and dismissive of people who do not live their
lives with integrity.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs will be very courageous if they see other people being badly treated but generally they can be unassertive and indirect in their communications and will usually avoid conflict if they can. 

<br/>
<br/>

All P types find organisation hard to master, but INFPs find it
particularly difficult. They tend to be unmethodical in their approach
to tasks and as Ns they often don’t pay enough attention to practical
details. Unless they have consciously trained themselves to be
methodical, INFPs usually feel under confident in this area of their
life, knowing intuitively that at any moment their scant attention to
practical details could present major problems.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs have to be careful that their idealism does not make them
perfectionists. If it does they may never complete projects, such as
writing a book, for fear it is not good enough or they may never have
a truly close relationship because they never meet the "perfect"
person. This idealism and perfectionism can also be turned against
themselves. Of all the types, INFPs and ISFPs, can be extremely
self-critical.

<br/>
<br/>

Ultimately success in life for INFPs depends on them finding ways to
honour their deeply held values and feel authentic while at the same
time keeping this side of themselves within useful bounds. Accepting
that life is by definition imperfect and full of compromises may be
difficult for INFPs but it will help them feel more self-confident and
fulfilled.  Enhancing their time management and organisational skills
is usually important for most INFPs as it can make them more
effective.

Common relationship Issues for INFPs

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs show caring by unobtrusively getting to know people well and
then communicating their empathy when needed often in low-key,
sensitive communications –e.g. writing notes or phoning at important
times for the other.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs like others to act in ways which show appreciation of them as
unique individuals and/or validates their insights or ideas in some
way.

<br/>
<br/>

As an INFP you are an Introverted-Feeler capable of immense
sensitivity and an enormous emotional capacity which you guard
closely.  The facade protecting your essential personality is solid,
but vulnerable when exposed to misplaced trust.  You have to know
people well before you will display your warmth, let down your guard
and extend your trust.  Once you allow someone to know the richness
and depth of the real you, you hope they appreciate the value of your
gift.

<br/>
<br/>

Relationships are a crucial focus for the Intuitive-Feeler.  You
desire to understand others deeply and to have that understanding
returned with loving acceptance.  In relationships, you invest your
time, energy, and total self.  But you have probably experienced some
disappointment in relationships because few understand the depths of
knowing you seek.  Others are simply incapable of forging that kind of
personal connection.

<br/>
<br/>

In the style of an Introvert, you naturally value inner processes over
external signs.  As a friend, you can go for some time without
connecting and still know a positive relationship exists.  Your
feelings do not fade with time or distance.  When a friend is in need,
you will be there this week, next month or ten years from now.  You
tend to form quiet, unwavering, loyal friendships that confound your
Extraverted colleagues.  For you and others like you who experience
emotions so deeply and personally, disappointments relating to
mismatched affection can be crippling.

<br/>
<br/>

In general, your actions and attitudes are guided by a solid set of
internal values that are not affected by the judgements or opinions of
others.  As a result, causes and people that attract you receive your
commitment and devotion.  You take your responsibilities seriously,
driven by your own understanding and feelings of morality.

<br/>
<br/>

You may be described as the quintessential idealist.  But often a
suffering one since you are painfully aware of how the world could be,
and how your understanding rarely matches reality.  Creating meaning
and significance of the self, of work and of relationships is a prime
driver for Intuiting-Feeling Personality Types.  Yet all you truly
desire is understanding and acceptance without pretence.  Genuineness,
authenticity and sincerity matter to you most.

<br/>
<br/>

It is also true that many with your Personality Type have to struggle
in order to find an outward focus for feelings a work or mission where
you have an impact.  Failing to do so can leave you forever looking
inward, alienated and disappointed by the shallowness and
superficiality of the world.  You are always working on understanding
others and searching for rich hidden meanings in your world.

<br/>
<br/>

Your talents work well in counselling and ministerial fields.  You
instinctively know how to reach people and how to communicate your
vision with clarity, whether speaking with them directly or in
persuasive writing.  More than any other personality style, you are
able to touch and move people with the quiet passion, sincerity and
authenticity of your communication.

<br/>
<br/>

As an Introvert, functioning in a sea of people may be exhausting and
draining.  But, as a Feeling person, living a life of isolation would
be unimaginable.  Despite your attraction for human companionship, you
prefer working alone and in a quiet environment.  If the telephone
never rings, you are delighted, particularly when deeply
concentrating.  You work best when no one intrudes or interrupts your
train of thought.  You will find your greatest comfort through
compromise interacting with others, closely, intimately, and mostly in
small, co-operative groups or one-on-one.  Always, the personal
element will be important in all you do.  You work for your fellow man
and you write for people to understand your thoughts.

<br/>
<br/>

Yours is the personality of the visionary.  You trust your intuition
and you are willing to act at an instinctual level.  Somehow you sense
good and evil in people and situations and are willing to make value
judgements on the basis of intangible data that might baffle other
Personality Types.  Re-tracing how you arrived at a thought or insight
in a consistent, well-defined sequence is unimportant to you, and
rarely possible anyway.  But more often than not, events confirm your
judgement.  You have a sweeping awareness of time and history in all
you do.  You have a respect for the past and for tradition.  You
experience the moment.  You look toward the future.  Sometimes you can
do all three at once.

<br/>
<br/>

Creativity is your hallmark.  You are a true perfectionist when it
comes to your work.  You see what you do as an extension of who you
are and, therefore, you are almost driven to do your best at any task
you undertake.  You envision a perfect job, an ideal design, a perfect
document, an excellent interaction and believe that your ideal is
attainable.

<br/>
<br/>

Harmony is essential for you in your personal and work environments
and as a result, dealing with hostility, criticism or a lack of
co-operation makes you unhappy.  You prefer to promote peace and
rapport among associates, friends and family.  Knowing the value of
appreciation, you have mastered of the art of sincere compliments,
encouragement and acknowledgement.  Likewise, you respond well to
praise yourself and perform your best when recognised for your
efforts.  But if your working world turns miserable, you may become
considerably stressed, lose your enthusiasm, confidence and the
ability to perform.

<br/>
<br/>

You live in a personal world which may be foreign to other Types
sensitive, artistic and imaginative, far removed from the here and now
and definitely disinclined to make decisions on a logical basis.  The
challenge you must face is to keep that tremendous sensitivity as an
asset - to let your vision inspire, not cripple you and to find a
mission in life where your special qualities can blossom.

<br/>
<br/>

Your Perceiving nature likes variety at work.  Being flexible and
shifting gears from one project, assignment or technique to another is
easy for you.  You prefer to be open and patient with changes and
ambiguous situations.  On the other hand, your desire for variety may
lead you to initiate change without being asked or revising material
when it is unnecessary.  Your openness and flexibility can also leave
you prone to be pulled in other directions without first finishing
what is at hand.  Without some awareness of this potential problem,
many of your activities could wind up first postponed, then forgotten.
At worst, others could perceive you as unreliable and not able to
follow-through with your ideas.

<br/>
<br/>

With work, it is apparent that you will be at your best dedicated to a
career, organisation or position that you truly believe in.  It is
essential that your work be meaningful and allow you to make a
difference in people’s lives or in the world.  Once committed to a
job, you can easily slip into being a perfectionist and competitive.
This is because you want to win by bringing the ideal into reality.
Outside of work, the impulse to compete with others simply does not
occur to you to be worth the effort.

<br/>
<br/>

No matter what field you choose, your career will reflect your
sincerity, enthusiasm and dedication, born from your heartfelt
commitment to your calling.

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are the true idealists.  Much of their lives can be said to be
viewed through  "rose-colored glasses". 

<br/>
<br/>

"Hope springs eternal" is a good motto which describes their decided
philosophy for the rugged places in relationships or the causes to
which they commit themselves - for they can pity the most unpitiable
and attempt to placate the most tyrannical. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are deeply caring and entrenched in striving for harmony in all
situations, their deeply-held spiritual and core values giving them
guidance and lending them sustenance in difficult situations. 

<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are deeply involved in a rich, inner life which can be holy in
content or escapist in reality.  They are also deeply sensitive and -
being quite tenderhearted - are quite easy to have their feelings
hurt.  They are apt to think whispering and jokes are at their
expense, when none such is intended. 
 
<br/>
<br/>

Mystical and creative, the INFP's life can also be nearly non-human -
ethereal - no matter which side of it they are viewing.  Even as
children, they exhibit the ability to "lose themselves" in the fairy
tales they read and project themselves into daydreams of lofty
grandeur or to have imaginary playmates who are very real to them.
Even their sharing of their experiences have an imaginary air about
them.  Unintentionally, they may add what they "felt" to the telling
rather than what "really was". 
 
<br/>
<br/>

INFPs are quiet, creative, idealistic - and are "true-blue" friends.
Many times it is their unquestioning loyalty that leads relationships
in which they are involved to continue - even with those who are not
worthy of such freely given devotion. 

<br/>
<br/>

Generous in spirit, they are able to sustain abuse beyond merit and to
invite their generosities to be abused by others for their own
advantage - until one day, without warning, they erupt with rage and
candor which surprise not only the recipient but the INFPs
themselves. 

<br/>
<br/>

They have the ability to avoid situations that are imminently
threatening to their inner peace by withdrawing from the
"give-and-take" arena and escaping into an inner world of enjoyment,
pleasure and insights.  They are deeply wounded by "man's inhumanity
to man" but their gentleness and sensitivities rarely enable them to
publicly crusade as their INFJ brethren. 

<br/>
<br/>

Like their INFJ brethren, the EST world of business is an
energy-sapping enterprise for them and they, too, suffer various
muscular and emotional maladies which require quiet times replete with
inspirational music and meditation to heal their weary spirits. 

<br/>
<br/>

The "drive to perfection" is a painful side of life for INFPs for whom
the Ideal is always just beyond the reach.  Even enjoyable moments are
not always spontaneously entered into for fear of having to "lose" the
joy or "pay for it" in some unknown, dark and painful way. 

<br/>
<br/>

The deeply religious INFP has capacity for the mystical side of
religion and gains insights not enjoyed by all types into "the deeper
things of God".  They can even long for "martyrdom" to "prove" their
deep, hidden and rich love for God and the heavenlies. 

<br/>
<br/>

Conscientious at times to a fault, INFPs are deserving of recognition
for the generosity of their caring spirits.  The world is a better
place because of their gentle and unassuming natures.
